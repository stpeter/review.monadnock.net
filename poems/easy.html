<h3>It's easy</h3>
<h4>by Tanya Wendling</h4>
It's easy to compose Shakespearean sonnets<br />
just hum the rhythm and then add some words &#151;<br />
first find your meaning and then put rimes on it;<br />
rimes needn't be exact (like "words" and "birds")<br />
but actually can bring the most delight<br />
when from unlikely corners they are dragged<br />
and laid beside their fellows in the light<br />
to startle like a cat out of the bag.<br />
But most of all, be sure to frequently<br />
allude to lovers whom you give no name<br />
so scholars bored with art's uncertainty<br />
can peep into your life without Tom's shame<br />
and in each final couplet you create<br />
will find a coupling that their work fun makes.
