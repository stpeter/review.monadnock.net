<h3>On Mynydd Troed</h3>
<h4>by Nicholas Dykes</h4>
<p><em>For my friends at the Bronllys Pain Management Centre</em></p>
<p>
On Mynydd Troed &#151; Mount Foot &#151;<br />
I overcame an enemy inside me, pain.<br />
I climbed the smooth old path alone, on foot,<br />
But in such agony of doubt that at the final crest<br />
I stopped amazed; breath rasping, legs trembling, dazed,<br /> 
My heart almost bursting from my chest.<br />
Then I looked back down the greening slope<br />
And felt the soaring joy of answered hope:<br />
I was standing on a mountain top again.
</p>
<p>
On Mynydd Troed I raised my staff and hand<br />
Like an ancient traveller, a seer,<br />
Arrived at the gateway to his promised land.<br />
The grey clouds broke, as if a sea had parted;<br />
Bright shafts of light dispelled all shred of fear,<br />
And deep within the laughter started<br />
As I let the eternal note of gladness in.
</p>
<p>
On Mynydd Troed the wind was sweet<br />
As I gazed at the quilt of fields and farms<br />
That wrapped and warmed the mountain's feet &#151;<br />
A supple, singing breeze which kissed the harms<br />
That I had suffered from my brow and face.<br />
Its soft caress soothed off every trace<br />
Of pain, of anger, of sadness and of sorrow<br />
And sang to me of an endless morrow;<br />
While on my lined and stubbled cheeks it etched anew<br />
The childlike lineaments of bliss.
