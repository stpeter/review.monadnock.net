<h3>On Reading James Joyce</h3>
<h4>by Tom Radcliffe</h4>
<h3>Before</h3>
<p>
Slippery silken rhythms slide<br />
down darkened passageways that hide<br />
long buried hurts and ancient scars<br />
and weapons strewn on Field of Mars<br />
from battles fought and won and lost<br />
where magic bled to pay the cost.
</p>
<p>
Slippery silken rhythms wake<br />
the Kraken reaching out to take<br />
the shoals of memory in its arms<br />
and twist the mind: send out alarms!<br />
Bear up against the pressure now,<br />
in slides the painful lance "moocow".
</p>
<p>
Slippery silken rhythms glide<br />
past censors, shutters, down they ride<br />
to touch the darkest depths of soul,<br />
distract, disturb, unpack, unroll<br />
the core of man, the core of child:<br />
the human, and beneath, the wild.
</p>
<h3>After</h3>
<p>
We used to think that healing meant: keep still<br />
and wrapped a broken leg in plaster cast,<br />
then atrophy of muscle brought new ills:<br />
flaccid my thigh, and stiffened knee held fast<br />
by sinews frozen in ungentle cage,<br />
helplessly chained, beyond my power to bend<br />
until through spasm's unexpected rage<br />
the crackling knee is flexed beyond the end.<br />
Sharp pain it brings, first healing fire's burn,<br />
to limb unused long quiet winter's night;<br />
child's cries ring out, to feel the life return,<br />
freedom bringing unexpected plight.<br />
For joy brings pain where stillness long held sway<br />
first steps are forced along the joyful way.
