<h3>Vampire Love</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
My darling, since you last went out<br />
At night, I think you've changed.<br />
My heart is turning dark with doubt.<br />
I fear my brain's deranged.
</p>
<p>
I've noticed that your blotchy skin<br />
Is somehow getting clearer.<br />
I've noticed that you're paler in<br />
Your image in the mirror.
</p>
<p>
Is that a hickey on your neck?<br />
What are those two red dots?<br />
Don't tell me that was just a peck!<br />
Now, do you have the hots
</p>
<p>
For someone else?  Who was that guy<br />
I saw you with last night?<br />
He slipped away before my eye,<br />
As if he'd taken flight.
</p>
<p>
Oh darling, I am sick at heart.<br />
You're going out again?<br />
Give me a kiss before we part<br />
To ease this aching pain.
