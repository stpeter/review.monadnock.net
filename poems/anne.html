<h3>Anne</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
I loved to hear her talk about the Pennsylvania hills<br />
Where the green trees shade the sunshine and the cold clear water spills<br />
Down the slopes in twisting streamlets to collect in rocky pools<br />
Where a girl could splash her cares away, away from all the rules<br />
Of what to say&nbsp;&#151; of what to do&nbsp;&#151; dissolved in nature's law,<br />
As her eyes soaked up the beauty and her heart filled up with awe.
</p>
<p>
In her life she bore three children, and taught them all she could,<br />
And to each she passed the vision of that symphony in wood,<br />
And I hear her voice to this day, when my wife makes ahs and oohs<br />
As we ride across the countryside in search of yet more views.<br />
That sacred spirit still lives on within her sons and daughter,<br />
The spirit of that little girl, at play in mountain water.
