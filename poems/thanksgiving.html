<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
With freedom's blessing spread upon the table,<br />
With friends and family gathered round the feast,<br />
We celebrate the fact that we are able<br />
To thrive here in this boldly settled land.<br />
Behind us lies a heritage of starving<br />
Beneath the rule of nobleman and priest.<br />
Before us sits a turkey we are carving<br />
To pile meat high for every outstretched hand.
</p>
<p>
And so we thank the Pilgrims' yearning vision<br />
That there must be a way to live anew<br />
Where each was free to make his own decision<br />
Of how and what to plant &#151; and then to reap<br />
The fruits of his own efforts &#151; and to keep<br />
The bounty of the harvest as his due.
