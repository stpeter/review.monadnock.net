<h4>Eloisa to Abelard</h4>
<div class="original">
<p>
In these deep solitudes and awful cells,<br />
Where heav'nly-pensive contemplation dwells,<br />
And ever-musing melancholy reigns;<br />
What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?<br />
Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?<br />
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?<br />
Yet, yet I love! &#151; From Abelard it came,<br />
And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.
</p>
<p>
Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,<br />
Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd.<br />
Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,<br />
Where mix'd with God's, his lov'd idea lies:<br />
O write it not, my hand &#151; the name appears<br />
Already written &#151; wash it out, my tears!<br />
In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,<br />
Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.
</p>
<p>
Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains<br />
Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:<br />
Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;<br />
Ye grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn!<br />
Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep,<br />
And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!<br />
Though cold like you, unmov'd, and silent grown,<br />
I have not yet forgot myself to stone.<br />
All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,<br />
Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;<br />
Nor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,<br />
Nor tears, for ages, taught to flow in vain.
</p>
<p>
Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,<br />
That well-known name awakens all my woes.<br />
Oh name for ever sad! for ever dear!<br />
Still breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.<br />
I tremble too, where'er my own I find,<br />
Some dire misfortune follows close behind.<br />
Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,<br />
Led through a sad variety of woe:<br />
Now warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom,<br />
Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!<br />
There stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,<br />
There died the best of passions, love and fame.
</p>
<p>
Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join<br />
Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.<br />
Nor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away;<br />
And is my Abelard less kind than they?<br />
Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,<br />
Love but demands what else were shed in pray'r;<br />
No happier task these faded eyes pursue;<br />
To read and weep is all they now can do.
</p>
<p>
Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;<br />
Ah, more than share it! give me all thy grief.<br />
Heav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,<br />
Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;<br />
They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,<br />
Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,<br />
The virgin's wish without her fears impart,<br />
Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,<br />
Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,<br />
And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.
</p>
<p>
Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,<br />
When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;<br />
My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,<br />
Some emanation of th' all-beauteous Mind.<br />
Those smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry day,<br />
Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.<br />
Guiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you sung;<br />
And truths divine came mended from that tongue.<br />
From lips like those what precept fail'd to move?<br />
Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love.<br />
Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,<br />
Nor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man.<br />
Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;<br />
Nor envy them, that heav'n I lose for thee.
</p>
<p>
How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,<br />
Curse on all laws but those which love has made!<br />
Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,<br />
Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies,<br />
Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,<br />
August her deed, and sacred be her fame;<br />
Before true passion all those views remove,<br />
Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?<br />
The jealous God, when we profane his fires,<br />
Those restless passions in revenge inspires;<br />
And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,<br />
Who seek in love for aught but love alone.<br />
Should at my feet the world's great master fall,<br />
Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all:<br />
Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove;<br />
No, make me mistress to the man I love;<br />
If there be yet another name more free,<br />
More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!<br />
Oh happy state! when souls each other draw,<br />
When love is liberty, and nature, law:<br />
All then is full, possessing, and possess'd,<br />
No craving void left aching in the breast:<br />
Ev'n thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,<br />
And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.<br />
This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)<br />
And once the lot of Abelard and me.
</p>
<p>
Alas, how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise!<br />
A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!<br />
Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,<br />
Her poniard, had oppos'd the dire command.<br />
Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;<br />
The crime was common, common be the pain.<br />
I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,<br />
Let tears, and burning blushes speak the rest.
</p>
<p>
Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,<br />
When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?<br />
Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,<br />
When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?<br />
As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,<br />
The shrines all trembl'd, and the lamps grew pale:<br />
Heav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd,<br />
And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.<br />
Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,<br />
Not on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:<br />
Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,<br />
And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.<br />
Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;<br />
Those still at least are left thee to bestow.<br />
Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,<br />
Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,<br />
Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;<br />
Give all thou canst &#151; and let me dream the rest.<br />
Ah no! instruct me other joys to prize,<br />
With other beauties charm my partial eyes,<br />
Full in my view set all the bright abode,<br />
And make my soul quit Abelard for God.
</p>
<p>
Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,<br />
Plants of thy hand, and children of thy pray'r.<br />
From the false world in early youth they fled,<br />
By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.<br />
You rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd,<br />
And Paradise was open'd in the wild.<br />
No weeping orphan saw his father's stores<br />
Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;<br />
No silver saints, by dying misers giv'n,<br />
Here brib'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n:<br />
But such plain roofs as piety could raise,<br />
And only vocal with the Maker's praise.<br />
In these lone walls (their days eternal bound)<br />
These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,<br />
Where awful arches make a noonday night,<br />
And the dim windows shed a solemn light;<br />
Thy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray,<br />
And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.<br />
But now no face divine contentment wears,<br />
'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.<br />
See how the force of others' pray'rs I try,<br />
(O pious fraud of am'rous charity!)<br />
But why should I on others' pray'rs depend?<br />
Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!<br />
Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,<br />
And all those tender names in one, thy love!<br />
The darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd<br />
Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,<br />
The wand'ring streams that shine between the hills,<br />
The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,<br />
The dying gales that pant upon the trees,<br />
The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;<br />
No more these scenes my meditation aid,<br />
Or lull to rest the visionary maid.<br />
But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,<br />
Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,<br />
Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws<br />
A death-like silence, and a dread repose:<br />
Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,<br />
Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green,<br />
Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,<br />
And breathes a browner horror on the woods.
</p>
<p>
Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;<br />
Sad proof how well a lover can obey!<br />
Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;<br />
And here, ev'n then, shall my cold dust remain,<br />
Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,<br />
And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.
</p>
<p>
Ah wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in vain,<br />
Confess'd within the slave of love and man.<br />
Assist me, Heav'n! but whence arose that pray'r?<br />
Sprung it from piety, or from despair?<br />
Ev'n here, where frozen chastity retires,<br />
Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.<br />
I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;<br />
I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;<br />
I view my crime, but kindle at the view,<br />
Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;<br />
Now turn'd to Heav'n, I weep my past offence,<br />
Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.<br />
Of all affliction taught a lover yet,<br />
'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!<br />
How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,<br />
And love th' offender, yet detest th' offence?<br />
How the dear object from the crime remove,<br />
Or how distinguish penitence from love?<br />
Unequal task! a passion to resign,<br />
For hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as mine.<br />
Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,<br />
How often must it love, how often hate!<br />
How often hope, despair, resent, regret,<br />
Conceal, disdain &#151; do all things but forget.<br />
But let Heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis fir'd;<br />
Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspir'd!<br />
Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,<br />
Renounce my love, my life, myself &#151; and you.<br />
Fill my fond heart with God alone, for he<br />
Alone can rival, can succeed to thee.
</p>
<p>
How happy is the blameless vestal's lot!<br />
The world forgetting, by the world forgot.<br />
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!<br />
Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;<br />
Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;<br />
"Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;"<br />
Desires compos'd, affections ever ev'n,<br />
Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n.<br />
Grace shines around her with serenest beams,<br />
And whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams.<br />
For her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms,<br />
And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes,<br />
For her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring,<br />
For her white virgins hymeneals sing,<br />
To sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away,<br />
And melts in visions of eternal day.
</p>
<p>
Far other dreams my erring soul employ,<br />
Far other raptures, of unholy joy:<br />
When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,<br />
Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,<br />
Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,<br />
All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.<br />
Oh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious night!<br />
How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!<br />
Provoking Daemons all restraint remove,<br />
And stir within me every source of love.<br />
I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,<br />
And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.<br />
I wake &#151; no more I hear, no more I view,<br />
The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.<br />
I call aloud; it hears not what I say;<br />
I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.<br />
To dream once more I close my willing eyes;<br />
Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!<br />
Alas, no more &#151; methinks we wand'ring go<br />
Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,<br />
Where round some mould'ring tower pale ivy creeps,<br />
And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.<br />
Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;<br />
Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.<br />
I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,<br />
And wake to all the griefs I left behind.
</p>
<p>
For thee the fates, severely kind, ordain<br />
A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;<br />
Thy life a long, dead calm of fix'd repose;<br />
No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.<br />
Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,<br />
Or moving spirit bade the waters flow;<br />
Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n,<br />
And mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n.
</p>
<p>
Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?<br />
The torch of Venus burns not for the dead.<br />
Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;<br />
Ev'n thou art cold &#151; yet Eloisa loves.<br />
Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn<br />
To light the dead, and warm th' unfruitful urn.
</p>
<p>
What scenes appear where'er I turn my view?<br />
The dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,<br />
Rise in the grove, before the altar rise,<br />
Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.<br />
I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,<br />
Thy image steals between my God and me,<br />
Thy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear,<br />
With ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear.<br />
When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,<br />
And swelling organs lift the rising soul,<br />
One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,<br />
Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:<br />
In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,<br />
While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.
</p>
<p>
While prostrate here in humble grief I lie,<br />
Kind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye,<br />
While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,<br />
And dawning grace is op'ning on my soul:<br />
Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!<br />
Oppose thyself to Heav'n; dispute my heart;<br />
Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes<br />
Blot out each bright idea of the skies;<br />
Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;<br />
Take back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs;<br />
Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;<br />
Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!
</p>
<p>
No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;<br />
Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!<br />
Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,<br />
Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee.<br />
Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;<br />
Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.<br />
Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view!)<br />
Long lov'd, ador'd ideas, all adieu!<br />
Oh Grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly fair!<br />
Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!<br />
Fresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the sky!<br />
And faith, our early immortality!<br />
Enter, each mild, each amicable guest;<br />
Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest!
</p>
<p>
See in her cell sad Eloisa spread,<br />
Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.<br />
In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,<br />
And more than echoes talk along the walls.<br />
Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,<br />
From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.<br />
"Come, sister, come!" (it said, or seem'd to say)<br />
"Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!<br />
Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,<br />
Love's victim then, though now a sainted maid:<br />
But all is calm in this eternal sleep;<br />
Here grief forgets to groan, and love to weep,<br />
Ev'n superstition loses ev'ry fear:<br />
For God, not man, absolves our frailties here."
</p>
<p>
I come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs,<br />
Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs.<br />
Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,<br />
Where flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow:<br />
Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,<br />
And smooth my passage to the realms of day;<br />
See my lips tremble, and my eye-balls roll,<br />
Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!<br />
Ah no &#151; in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,<br />
The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,<br />
Present the cross before my lifted eye,<br />
Teach me at once, and learn of me to die.<br />
Ah then, thy once-lov'd Eloisa see!<br />
It will be then no crime to gaze on me.<br />
See from my cheek the transient roses fly!<br />
See the last sparkle languish in my eye!<br />
Till ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;<br />
And ev'n my Abelard be lov'd no more.<br />
O Death all-eloquent! you only prove<br />
What dust we dote on, when 'tis man we love.
</p>
<p>
Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,<br />
(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy)<br />
In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,<br />
Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,<br />
From op'ning skies may streaming glories shine,<br />
And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.
</p>
<p>
May one kind grave unite each hapless name,<br />
And graft my love immortal on thy fame!<br />
Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,<br />
When this rebellious heart shall beat no more;<br />
If ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings<br />
To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,<br />
O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,<br />
And drink the falling tears each other sheds;<br />
Then sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd,<br />
"Oh may we never love as these have lov'd!"
</p>
<p>
From the full choir when loud Hosannas rise,<br />
And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,<br />
Amid that scene if some relenting eye<br />
Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,<br />
Devotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n,<br />
One human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n.<br />
And sure, if fate some future bard shall join<br />
In sad similitude of griefs to mine,<br />
Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,<br />
And image charms he must behold no more;<br />
Such if there be, who loves so long, so well;<br />
Let him our sad, our tender story tell;<br />
The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;<br />
He best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most.
