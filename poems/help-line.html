<h3>24-Hour Help Line</h3>
<h4>by Meredith Patterson</h4>
<p>
By this point I've been waiting here three hours:<br />
Just some bored keyboard jockey on the line<br />
While technoweenies on the other end<br />
Yap back and forth and drink their Mountain Dew<br />
And try to figure out if it's a driver<br />
Or interrupt or hardware glitch at fault.
</p>
<p>
I built the damn machine, so it's my fault<br />
For stewing on this box so many hours<br />
That someone sane would want to hire a driver<br />
To take them round the bend. Could be the line<br />
In sound jack or a PCI slot. Do<br />
The pricey vendors also sell an end
</p>
<p>
To hardware trauma? I can see the end<br />
Just past this next device protection fault;<br />
But these are hardware wonks, not wonks who do<br />
The software thing. "Oh, sure, they keep their hours<br />
Around the clock, but on a different line.<br />
They'd be the ones to know if it's a driver."
</p>
<p>
And by this point I'd like a three-wood driver<br />
To smash the goddamn card &#151; but then the end<br />
Can't justify itself. There's not a line<br />
On earth that could explain away a fault<br />
Like that, and I'd have wasted three-odd hours<br />
Along with ninety bucks. And I could do
</p>
<p>
Some more productive thing right now, but do<br />
Not out-guess geek tenacity. One <em>driver</em>.<br />
As long as I can get that fix, the hours<br />
Are worth more than their fifteen per. I'll end<br />
This soon, some way. A stupid hardware fault.<br />
I could just spend a quarter hour in line
</p>
<p>
And give the damn thing back; some lamer line<br />
About how there was nothing I could do<br />
To make it work &#151; most wouldn't call that fault.<br />
But geeks have pride, and will not let a driver<br />
Or other piece of software bring an end<br />
To what we call fun, damn the sleepless hours.
</p>
<p>
It's how we are. We'll kludge past any fault<br />
And brag about the hack &#151; because it's <em>ours</em>.<br />
Who cares how ugly? 'Least it works. The end.
