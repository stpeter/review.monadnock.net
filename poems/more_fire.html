<h3>More Fire</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
Serenity is wonderful, and quiet contemplation<br />
Should be a part of everybody's life.<br />
But in my own experience, a jolt of raw sensation<br />
Can be a better help in times of strife.
</p>
<p>
It's good to be above it all &#151; it's good to feel complete &#151;<br />
It's great to sense the oneness in all things;<br />
But when survival hinges on your power to compete,<br />
You'll need the force that only passion brings.
</p>
<p>
When meditation's over and the time has come to act,<br />
Let hot desire energize your brain.<br />
A candle flame is peaceful, but you'll find that it's a fact:<br />
You need more fire to face the wind and rain.
