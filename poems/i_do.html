<h3>I Do</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
What can it mean to say "I do" forever?<br />
We don't live for forever &#151; we live now<br />
And for some time to be, but we can never<br />
Know with certainty the twists and turns<br />
That lie ahead &#151; the when and why and how<br />
Of life's surprises &#151; and the flame that burns<br />
Within us for each other, hot and bright,<br />
Might flicker and go out, or be consumed<br />
In some new love for someone else's light.<br />
Why would I enter into such a vow<br />
When fortune telling is a game that's doomed?
</p>
<p>
Oh &#151; just because of all these great unknowns<br />
I dare to take a stand and take your hand.<br />
We are not rolling down a hill like stones,<br />
We do not merely bounce without a clue,<br />
But, more like ships, we steer through storms toward land,<br />
Then take to sea again &#151; the open blue<br />
Attracts us with its sparkling invitation<br />
To sights unseen &#151; to music never heard &#151;<br />
And not just rehash of some old sensation<br />
But startling new experience unplanned.<br />
Amidst all this, I offer you my word.
</p>
<p>
To keep my vessel cruising next to yours,<br />
Whatever winds may blow, whatever gales<br />
Wash over us &#151; as long as mind endures &#151;<br />
To keep your flags in sight.  For while the wind<br />
Is what gives all the power to our sails,<br />
Its pushing does not point our way.  Unpinned<br />
I tack against the gusting face of chance<br />
By dint of rudders, ropes, and careful craft.<br />
I keep eyes fixed across that wide expanse<br />
On my direction &#151; until eyesight fails,<br />
Though tempest tossed, though lost, though dazed and daft.
</p>
<p>
For like a compass pointing to the north,<br />
The arrow in my heart points tried and true,<br />
And by its pain I know when, back or forth,<br />
My way has strayed from where I want to be.<br />
All this is what I mean by my "I do."<br />
Oh, darling, will you say the same for me?<br />
I cannot ask for more than that you try<br />
To keep me in your sights while yet you can.<br />
I know that even true loves sometimes die,<br />
But while it lives I offer mine to you:<br />
Be my woman, and I'll be your man.
