<h3>Weight</h3>
<h4>by Rachel Astarte Piccione</h4>
<p>
I keep my body<br />
smaller than<br />
my soul<br />
just so there will be<br />
no question.
</p>
<p>
But there always is.<br />
One, dumb test.<br />
One painfully, exhausting<br />
push<br />
to see what I'll do,<br />
say.
</p>
<p>
Someone inevitably thinks he can<br />
pick me up,<br />
spin me around,<br />
toss me away.
</p>
<p>
If he looked closely<br />
he'd see how heavy<br />
I am.<br />
How all of his<br />
muscles working together<br />
could not budge me.
</p>
<p>
Like the woman trapped<br />
under the car<br />
who lifted it&nbsp;&#151; <br />
the whole thing&nbsp;&#151; <br />
off herself because she had to<br />
in order to survive,<br />
my strength is<br />
quiet;<br />
you wouldn't know <br />
it was there.
</p>
<p>
Unless you tried<br />
to lift me.
