<h3>My Daughter's Face</h3>
<h4>by Tom Radcliffe</h4>
<h3>1: Bystander</h3>
<p>
I was a bystander in every sense<br />
excepting only at the thrusting start:<br />
My contribution dying to past tense<br />
after that brief spasmodic shock of heart<br />
and breath where each of us is first begun.<br />
Then I stood back and helped out where I could<br />
at ease expecting now these things to run<br />
their course as twice before they had, they would.<br />
But not this time, and so I changed midstream<br />
from loving observer to a horror-<br />
filled bystander at a crash of genes<br />
that left its victim neither undone nor<br />
complete and whole and fit for healthy life.<br />
I just stood by: to wait upon my wife.
</p>
<h3>2: Statistical Analysis</h3>
<p>
When I picked up the phone the odds were good,<br />
one in at least two hundred 'gainst, or near.<br />
Her voice was calm but tense, I understood<br />
with clench of gut and thump of primal fear<br />
the odds had closed to something wildly worse:<br />
To less than one in ten, or even eight<br />
by any road significant reverse;<br />
we'd waited long for this, perhaps too late.<br />
I ran the reassuring numbers then:<br />
when was the last time she had got an 'A'<br />
on an exam and felt she missed those ten<br />
last points dropped off somewhere along the way?<br />
My stats gave voice to optimistic hope,<br />
but still she knew her place in sample's scope.
</p>
<h3>3: Not Right</h3>
<p>
Numbers have simple truth, exactly known,<br />
but the body tells a richer tale of<br />
blood and kidney, heart, stomach, liver, bone<br />
that holds truth complex, which we can't resolve<br />
with spectrograph or blood work instruments.<br />
And still we listen to the number's lies,<br />
with all their missing facts, and ignorance;<br />
but truth lurks dark behind her shadowed eyes<br />
when now she says, "I know something's not right."<br />
I try to reassure her, futilely --<br />
I can't deny her blood-and-bones insight --<br />
but I crave hard number's reality<br />
for she sees future's shape with every breath:<br />
The growing child within her doomed to death.
</p>
<h3>4: On the Possibility of Moral Calculation Under Uncertainty</h3>
<p>
Down's syndrome has well-known distributions,<br />
of defects, limitations, mortal causes<br />
that all result in early dissolution<br />
of living breath and laboured heart's slow pauses.<br />
There are those lucky few who live full lives<br />
at least as rich, rewarding as their brother's,<br />
and then there are the more who fail to thrive,<br />
die young, too soon, and finally the others<br />
who dwell between, live out truncated years<br />
but mostly take their own care on themselves.<br />
What value has uncertain life, and fear,<br />
'gainst other children's happiness and wealth?<br />
O how to calculate: fold or stand pat<br />
when all she knows: this "might"'s worth more than that?
</p>
<h3>5: Waiting</h3>
<p>
The children want to know what's going on<br />
when Mom and Dad stand in cold kitchen now<br />
and puzzle over odds too short or long<br />
to end in silence, always wondering how<br />
they'll find their way through thickets and beliefs<br />
and reach an honest answer that will serve<br />
as something to remind them in their grief:<br />
they made their choices and they kept their nerve.<br />
She must choose the best for all concerned,<br />
I must choose whatever choice she makes --<br />
"To have, to hold, to honor"'s in my ears.<br />
I must not show her how my body shakes<br />
as time approaches fast. The moment nears,<br />
and finally when phone rings with news<br />
I know how much there is for us to lose.
</p>
<h3>6: Snow</h3>
<p>
The last thing I remember of outside<br />
the hospital is the soft scrunch of snow<br />
beneath my booted feet.  The icy slide<br />
of powder packed by patients' paths and plow<br />
into a firm, gently yielding crust of<br />
fresh clean white.  The sky above was going<br />
black with mother night whose enfolding glove<br />
was rising to take me in her grasping<br />
hand.  She was a quiet night, but angry<br />
then, I felt her wrath as she loomed over<br />
the dark bulking hospital; infirmary<br />
where my wife lay still under cold cover.<br />
Within these walls the three of us had gone<br />
but only two would live to see the dawn.
</p>
<h3>7: Certificates</h3>
<p>
"There'll need to be certificates filled out,<br />
as it's twenty weeks today.  Birth and death<br />
both -- you chose a name?"  A flash of doubt<br />
crossed then the nurse's face as I held breath,<br />
said, "Nineteen weeks, six days, she was admitted,<br />
and that will do for other dates as well."<br />
She looked at me, small nod, I was committed<br />
to this at least, if helpless in all else:<br />
To spare the painful rituals and dire<br />
mubbling of priest whose faith we do not hold,<br />
ignoring midnight's pass on ticking spire,<br />
by act of will escaping from time's fold.<br />
And now my heart gives one more timeless lurch.<br />
The form required: "Donation For Research."
</p>
<h3>8: On the Value of a Liberal Education</h3>
<p>
I lie awake half dozing on the cot<br />
wedged in small room at foot of private bed<br />
where she lies so still, holding off the thought<br />
that we are keeping watch here for the dead.<br />
My mind is drawn to other nights like this<br />
when I took care of long experiments,<br />
detectors, spectrometers, tape's soft hiss<br />
as data gathered filled out few, small rents<br />
in ragged fraying tissue of our knowedge.<br />
Then: reading Thomas Hardy passes time,<br />
far from the madding world, in cloistered college.<br />
Now: my soul is rendered down in lime.<br />
But memory of those nights sustains me here<br />
in loneliness, in emptiness, and fear.
</p>
<h3>9: Non Serviam</h3>
<p>
Cold rosy-fingered dawn, the winter's light<br />
leaks into the sky; I stand at the window<br />
wondering: do I know this choice is right?<br />
Then like a whale, fast surfacing to blow,<br />
wells up desire to call out now to God;<br />
to know that this is right, and to give up <br />
my mind, my soul, for one small certain nod<br />
from omnipotent disposer.  I refuse this cup;<br />
'twas offered once before, when as a youth<br />
I panic'd on a dive in ocean's deeps,<br />
wrest self-possession back from certain death<br />
by uncontrolled assent toward light that leaks<br />
into the winter sky.  I stand alone:<br />
bereft of God by choice, my soul my own.
</p>
<h3>10: My Daughter's Face</h3>
<p>
She lies there dead in blue aseptic pan,<br />
her tiny arms and legs, so perfect formed<br />
except the unseen fold 'cross palm of hand,<br />
and small eyes closed, now never to be born<br />
to see the light of day.  For here is my<br />
beautiful child, full of innocence, to know<br />
sin nor sorrow the more.  As I write, I<br />
cry, "Small part of me, you will always go<br />
along, however far and fast I move;<br />
your face, so peaceful now in death's repose,<br />
where joy should reign, and joyful father's love<br />
for cherished child should set the warming rose<br />
of laughter on that perfect face, so still,<br />
where now there only dwells death's awful chill."
</p>
<h3>11: Tears</h3>
<p>
Hours later, passing small talk in between<br />
long bouts of silence, staring into space,<br />
I felt the tears flood up and out, it seemed<br />
from everywhere: my eyes, my mouth, my face<br />
dissolved in liquid weeping, harsh racking<br />
sobs and consumptive gasps as fluid raced<br />
from every pore and duct where tears were backing<br />
up behind dams of weak reserve that could<br />
not keep them checked.  A social worker paused<br />
discreetly at the door, withdrew; she would<br />
ask me later, "Are you ok?"  My nod<br />
was proof I wasn't, yet, for more than tears<br />
would have to pass throughout the healing years.
</p>
<h3>12: Shrouds</h3>
<p>
Putting our shredded lives now back together,<br />
walking wounded, sometimes hand in her hand,<br />
more often space between, mourning never<br />
quite the same; neither really understands<br />
how much the other's lost or what it took<br />
to stay the course we both agreed was right.<br />
If simply standing by ripped like a hook<br />
through gut, spine, heart of my external sight,<br />
what must she feel, whose inner eyes could gaze<br />
on fluttering life that died so slow within?<br />
Our souls drift tattered 'round us, mourning daze,<br />
the trailing tendrils touch and intertwine<br />
and to the other we can't give comfort<br />
with each encompassed in a shell of hurt.
</p>
<h3>13: Doubt</h3>
<p>
Could I have done better if I was not<br />
the person who I am?  Now what looms large<br />
are doubts about my character; keen sought<br />
defense against too capital a charge.<br />
I am not skilled at failure, it's too rare,<br />
for all I have is built on, "Don't give up!"<br />
But now I need to meet death's icy stare<br />
and finally accept at least this cup:<br />
learn to face th' inevitable with grace,<br />
not wrack myself with fantasy of guilt<br />
that somehow I should have found out a place<br />
where she could fit into this world we've built.<br />
I'll drink the cup of doubt down to the lees;<br />
my victory: with grace accept defeat.
</p>
<h3>14: At the Core</h3>
<p>
Short weeks before I'd been making some soup<br />
and chopped an onion clean through living core<br />
thinking briefly of this most literary root<br />
and poor Peer Gynt peeling 'til nothing more<br />
remained but emptiness.  I'd put one half<br />
away, not needing it.  Now ordinary<br />
life was going on, the simplest staff<br />
of habit and routine, so salutary<br />
to souls in need of quiet healing time.<br />
More soup to make, found onion half in 'fridge<br />
and sat down on the floor like startled mime<br />
whose imagined chair vanished from the stage;<br />
for onion's empty core was sprouting green:<br />
In cold and dark, life still reigned supreme.
</p>
<h3>15: Letting Go</h3>
<p>
There is a time to let the seed of doubt<br />
assail you, and a time to let it go;<br />
a time to probe each alternative route,<br />
and then a time to focus with the flow<br />
of living motion: look now future hence;<br />
we can only take one branch down the line --<br />
no progress made just sitting on the fence<br />
and waiting for the world to send a sign.<br />
And I do the nameless dead no honour<br />
if I can't get beyond my grief<br />
and end up stalled forever in my pain.<br />
So if I can build the joy she died for,<br />
and not forget what it has cost,<br />
then alone she won't have died in vain.
