<h3>Gelatinous</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
The gelatinous thing on the chair<br />
Gently smiled at me.<br />
Its eyes seemed to say "Yes, I care,<br />
Won't you sit on my knee?"
</p>
<p>
I gingerly placed my behind<br />
Where its knee should have been.<br />
I tried to sit, only to find<br />
What a mess I was in.
</p>
<p>
I tried to rise, only to learn<br />
I was stuck to my seat.<br />
I felt my flesh starting to burn<br />
With insidious heat.
</p>
<p>
I kicked and I clawed at the jelly,<br />
I fought to break out.<br />
I gouged its eyes, elbowed its belly<br />
And chomped on its snout.
</p>
<p>
The gelatinous thing on the chair<br />
Laughed and swallowed me whole,<br />
In one gulp, without pausing for air,<br />
Took me body and soul.
</p>
<p>
Now we sit in the chair.  We are one.<br />
Won't you sit on our knee?<br />
We care for you.  It will be fun.<br />
Just try it and see!
