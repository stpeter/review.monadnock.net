<h3>The Artist's Soul</h3>
<h4>by Karen Minto</h4>
<p>
Up from the clay that his fingers mold<br />
Comes a shape from the searching mind<br />
That seeks within the lifeless clay<br />
A form of his own design.
</p>
<p>
With skill acquired through years of error<br />
His hands move with swift precision<br />
Protruding and hollowing the moist, soft earth<br />
Making real what was merely a vision.
</p>
<p>
And when the completed article stands<br />
Approved before his eye<br />
He sees within the shapely earth<br />
A part of his soul that will never die.
