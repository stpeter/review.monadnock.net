<h3>D&#233;j&#224; Interpretation</h3>
<h4>by Meredith Patterson</h4>
<p>
I cannot be postmodern.  I'm too old.<br />
Too old &#151; at twenty &#151; to accept the thought<br />
Of words &#151; and words alone, however bold &#151;<br />
Replacing things that are with what is not.

<p>
Too old, at twenty, to accept the thought,<br />
Too timeworn and too fanciful to find<br />
Replacing things that are with what is not<br />
Could be so basic as a change of mind.
</p>
<p>
Too timeworn and too fanciful to find<br />
That habit, question, problem at the core<br />
Could be so basic as a change of mind;<br />
There's that, but then there's still godawful more &#151;
</p>
<p>
That habit, question, problem at the core<br />
Has action from decision as step one;<br />
There's that, but then there's still godawful more,<br />
For words are weak when they are words alone.
</p>
<p>
Has action from decision as step one<br />
Been overkill at all?  For me?  Not yet.<br />
For words are weak when they are words alone,<br />
And so I cannot trust a safety net
</p>
<p>
Of words and words alone, however bold.<br />
I cannot be postmodern.  I'm too old.
