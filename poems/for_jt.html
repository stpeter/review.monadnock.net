<h3>We cannot know it, yet we know it's true</h3>
<h4>by Tanya Wendling</h4>
<p><em>For J.T.</em></p>
<p>
We cannot know it, yet we know it's true:<br />
time does not pass, but like an atmosphere<br />
soaks up all thought and action, joy and fear<br />
and rains them down on us each day anew.<br />
We cannot know it, but the prophets knew<br />
time does not pass, and every passing year<br />
is just a tiny glass through which we peer<br />
into dazzling eternity: a view<br />
we cannot bear. Darling, regret soon dies<br />
from lack of food, for everything is here<br />
and that lovely, gem-eyed schoolgirl of your youth<br />
still dances where her dreams are realized<br />
and in your heart lives all that she holds dear<br />
and in your emerald eyes the dazzling truth.
