<h3>The Leaves</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
The leaves fell flaming red<br />
Like pieces of my heart.<br />
"They're beautiful," she said,<br />
And so we made a start
</p>
<p>
Of sifting through that treasure.<br />
Each spangled scarlet leaf<br />
Infused her heart with pleasure,<br />
While I, with grateful grief,
</p>
<p>
Beheld her inner being<br />
Still filled with bright delight.<br />
The simple act of seeing<br />
Outshined the looming night.
