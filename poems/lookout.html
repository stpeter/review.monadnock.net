<h3>Lookout Point</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
The city stands astride the river's mouth<br />
Where swampland for uncounted centuries<br />
Lay flat in soggy sleep. Miles to the south<br />
Atop a ridge, above a spread of trees,<br />
I stand, and gaze upon the awesome towers<br />
That seem to float like clouds, but never move.<br />
Day after day they're there, through all the hours<br />
And all the years, solid, as if to prove<br />
That all is possible &#151; that living dreams<br />
Can be achieved &#151; made real in stone and steel.<br />
The birds fly overhead and, far above,<br />
A jet roars 'cross the sky.  The sunlight gleams<br />
Upon its wings, and all that I can feel<br />
Is happy in the power of my love.
