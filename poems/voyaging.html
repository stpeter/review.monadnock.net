<h3>Voyaging</h3>
<h4>by Eric S. Raymond</h4>
<p>
First kiss, like the sun rising<br />
opens a light over lands made new;<br />
We send our ships across the seas between us<br />
We claim each other at a trembling verge.
</p>
<p>
Finding my way to your fragrant isle,<br />
Sweet musky mysteries draw me from afar;<br />
Shall I stumble ashore to wander in your forests?<br />
Shall I plant my staff with a roar?
</p>
<p>
Danger and treasure, mingled and waiting;<br />
So it ever is when we seek the unknown.<br />
But remember this; the gods <em>made</em> us explorers!<br />
We were never meant to bide at home.
</p>
<p>
First kiss, like the sun rising;<br />
Could be we'll founder on uncharted shores.<br />
But better we'll be if we sailed in vain<br />
than never to have sailed at all.
