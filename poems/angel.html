<h3>I saw the angel in the stone and carved</h3>
<h4>by Tanya Wendling</h4>
<p>
I saw the angel in the stone and carved<br />
to set it free. It rose like one once cursed<br />
to rise and live again &#151; ill-formed at first<br />
and stood uncertain, its fierce visage scarred<br />
with awful hewing; its gaunt figure starved<br />
from lack of stone and earth. When once immersed<br />
in daylight's glare, it shook its wings and burst<br />
into the heavens, and left behind the hard<br />
stone as though untouched. Everything is found<br />
and lost and buried and then found again<br />
by one who feels the heat rise from the ground<br />
that holds the dead, or sees the purple stain<br />
spread on the grass at sunset, or hears the sound<br />
of lovers calling loved ones in the rain.
