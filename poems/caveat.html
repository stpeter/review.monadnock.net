<h3>Caveat Precator</h3>
<h4>by Meredith Patterson</h4>
<p><em>(Editor's note: 'precator' means supplicant.)</em></p>
<p>
You say, "Let me be moved"; but then you hold,<br />
In hopes some vaster Spirit will unfold<br />
Its wings before you, seeking to inspire<br />
Within you some more influential fire<br />
Than what, so far, has sputtered in your mind<br />
Like sparks on sodden kindling, aligned<br />
So no one log can catch another one;<br />
So your ideal makes itself undone.
</p>
<p>
You say, "Let me be moved"; but then you hold.<br />
As you tell me, were not you once so told?<br />
Consider, rather than celestial blaze,<br />
How subtle movement for compounded days<br />
Builds friction &#151; heat &#151; and breaks at last to light<br />
That spreads itself from there.  No hallowed might<br />
Casts purpose down from some anointed throne;<br />
We have the will to forge it on our own.
</p>
<p>
You say, "Let me be moved"; but then you hold,<br />
Not knowing, without motion, life is <em>cold</em>.<br />
The crux is this:  Man's soul is not of wood,<br />
Nor aught unmoving stuff, nor that which could<br />
Be immolated any way but by<br />
A self-ignition.  Ingenuity<br />
Pursued, puts wicks in men, and in her name<br />
They chase her, and in doing, find their flame.
