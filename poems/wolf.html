<h3>Wolf</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
The little girl who found the wounded wolf<br />
And bandaged up its paw, had made a friend<br />
Who wouldn't leave her.  Though he seemed aloof,<br />
He walked along beside her without end,<br />
Quietly padding with dogged devotion,<br />
Sniffing the air and eyeing everyone<br />
Who came near her, and with a gentle motion<br />
Nudging her back at times.  When day is done,<br />
He curls up next to her and feels her warmth,<br />
And this is his idea of happiness.<br />
He does not know it's taken a strange form.<br />
His ears are tuned to listen to the beat<br />
Of her soft heart.  His tongue flicks out a kiss<br />
Upon her cheek and savors there the sweet<br />
Nature that nursed him back to health again.<br />
She falls to dreaming, safe within his den.
