<h3>First Call of a Redwing</h3>
<h4>by Nicholas Dykes</h4>
<p>
It was only a rusty redwing<br />
mulling among old brown reeds,<br />
but his cautious, throaty music<br />
was the first bright chord of spring.
</p>
<p>
And in a flash my godly soul<br />
flew up away forever,<br />
all vestige of its guileful face<br />
vanishing, traceless, into space.
</p>
<p>
And life was suddenly glorious,<br />
drenched with colours and light,<br />
for <em>I</em> was the runner in my blood,<br />
my precious mind its flight.
