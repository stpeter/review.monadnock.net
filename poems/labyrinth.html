<h3>Labyrinth</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
Gladly you walked the maze with me;<br />
Though it was dark, though I could hear<br />
The roaring of the Minotaur,<br />
You stood beside me in my fear.
</p>
<p>
And when it grew too dark to see<br />
What lay ahead, your voice was clear.<br />
And so I stepped as one who slept,<br />
And woke to find you standing near.
