<h3>What Child</h3>
<h4>by John Enright</h4>
<p>
Because we are not on this earth forever<br />
But only for a time; because we see<br />
Beyond ourselves to distant generations<br />
Where others, brave and true, are yet to be;
</p>
<p>
Because we know that humankind's endeavor<br />
Goes on and on without a stop in sight;<br />
Because we feel that fear and desperation<br />
Deserve to be dissolved in joyous light;
</p>
<p>
Why then we look at every newborn child<br />
With awed respect: for each may be the one<br />
To show the way&nbsp;&#151; to shoulder weights high-piled&nbsp;&#151; <br />
To throw off burdens crushing as a ton.
</p>
<p>
Behold Man's hopes: for giant steps are all<br />
Made by feet that once were soft and small.
