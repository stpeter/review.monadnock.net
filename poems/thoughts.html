<h3>Thoughts at Night</h3>
<h4>by Karen Minto</h4>
<p>
Seeing you makes me feel poetic all over<br />
Flowing, powerful but agelessly light<br />
As the velvet glow of wine sighs in my throat<br />
Our eyes meet, warmly caressed by the sight.
</p>
<p>
I am a singer, high upon a shining stage<br />
All around a great sparkling universe<br />
I have no audience but you in the darkness<br />
A presence set to melody, inspiring my verse.
</p>
<p>
The notes, my heart, I pour for you<br />
Through the air a stream of sweet bright love<br />
Splashing joyously into the crystal goblet of you<br />
The last drop to fall, my kiss, from above.
</p>
<p>
From a single glass we toast ourselves<br />
With your arms around me, we dance till dawn<br />
Around and around, our cheeks so close<br />
Sending stars in motion with the swirl of my gown.
</p>
<p>
And my face reflects yours, and yours mine<br />
Our smiles and kisses are one<br />
That spontaneous fire that ignites our souls<br />
Now burning freshly in the sky is a brand new Sun.
