<h3>Tintoretto's Paradise</h3>
<h4>by G. Wesley Purdy</h4>
<p><em>I</em></p>
<p>
He was called The Little Dyer &#151; Il Tintoretto &#151;<br />
and, though he had the name because his father<br />
had plied the trade, there is no doubt his fellow<br />
'pintori gave an edge to it. No matter:<br />
their primps and affectations &#151; their fine show &#151;<br />
all came to nothing more than so much clatter.<br />
They were mere interlopers &#151; pigment Moors &#151;<br />
washed up like countless others on those shores.
</p>
<p>
Yet he remained indeed a tintor's son,<br />
the name he bore encapsulating him<br />
until even silence was a revelation:<br />
the reticence of an ambitious tradesman<br />
who speaks, if he speaks at all, of lots and sums,<br />
or thinks aloud to his wife he'll move the basin<br />
from the window, to prevent the shop-boys' thoughts<br />
from wandering, and save the dimes it costs.
</p>
<p>
The painter's art had long been sold, by then,<br />
like sides of pork: three bodies eight feet high,<br />
the one a niece, the purling on her dress<br />
precise, the figure at a ducat-five.<br />
In this he was no different from the rest,<br />
but, all a pragmatist, he elbowed by;<br />
he sought to bring in work, to grind the paints,<br />
and make the buyers' favorites into saints.
</p>
<p>
He did Veronese better than the man<br />
himself, at half the price, in half the time;<br />
or, if the contract called for it, did Titian,<br />
more giorgionesca, vaster, more sublime;<br />
where the others saw a land of high romance,<br />
he painted violence, he advertised;<br />
while they searched for some unique Venetian thing,<br />
he gave Christ's suppers finer catering.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps already Venice somehow made<br />
it seem enough, perhaps it always had;<br />
roads paved with water, harbors filled with trade,<br />
still unaware that its best days had past,<br />
that all that yesterday had made it great<br />
today betrayed it to itself; perhaps,<br />
somehow, like the last rays of a setting sun,<br />
its greatest beauties were its light undone.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, Veronese had to die,<br />
and Titian dodder toward a hundred years,<br />
and Venice need to have a Paradise;<br />
the tintor's son, grown old, his own death near,<br />
but hand still slashing and still fierce of eye,<br />
contracted for his masterpiece; appeared<br />
to haggle inches, how each niece must pose,<br />
to wish good health, to sign, to bow and go.
</p>
<p><em>II</em></p>
<p>
In the Doge's Palace, in the Council Hall,<br />
above the Doge's and Signores' thrones,<br />
there is a Paradise upon the wall;<br />
above the Doge Christ rises up, on droves<br />
of seraphic three year olds, symbolical<br />
of prince and prince: a delegation none<br />
can now believe, and surely few could then,<br />
but fewer still saw what the symbols meant. 
</p>
<p>
It bears the trademark of Il Tintoretto<br />
although there's doubt he ever raised a brush<br />
to it. In Rome, great Michelangelo<br />
had broken health depicting God and such,<br />
and even he was at a loss to know<br />
just what the featuring of heaven was<br />
and left it blank. The Little Dyer knew<br />
he had a house to pay for, work to do.
