<h3>Two Poems on Death by William H. Stoddard</h3>
<h4>by William H. Stoddard</h4>
<h3>"That Obscure Object of Desire"</h3>
<p>
I care no more for mortal company:<br />
I wish instead to make a friend of death,<br />
Whom all the poets loved and won at last.<br />
Their power is the shaping of the breath,
</p>
<p>
And every breath is subject to her claim<br />
Enforced when breath at last is fallen still.<br />
I hear their sorrow voicing their desire<br />
And something answers them within my will,
</p>
<p>
So that I wish to resonate the sound<br />
Of treasured, fading breath with my own voice.<br />
Having been shown her loveliness by them<br />
I grow to love her now of my own choice.
</p>
<h3>For Allison, Who Writes Her Songs</h3>
<p>
Death is your lady, so you like to say,<br />
Seeing a blessing in mortality.<br />
You think she chastely waits the nuptial day<br />
At which you'll lose your last virginity.
</p>
<p>
Yours, but not hers.  Death is the oldest whore,<br />
Who's had so many lovers she's forgotten<br />
Even what species each one's body wore<br />
Before she drained its life and left it rotten.
</p>
<p>
Oh, not from her you'll gain inheritance<br />
Of children or estates or words repeated.<br />
When she grants you the pleasure of a dance<br />
You'll get your pocket picked before you're seated.
