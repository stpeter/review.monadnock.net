<h1>Jacob Bronowski: An Appreciation</h1>
<h3>Science and Human Values</h3>
<blockquote>
The world which the human mind knows and explores does not survive if it is emptied of thought. And thought does not survive without symbolic concepts. The symbol and the metaphor are as necessary to science as to poetry. (36)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Historically, concepts have commonly been set up as absolute and inborn notions, like the space and time which Kant believed to be ready-made in the mind. The view that our concepts are build up from experience, and have constantly to be tested and corrected in experience, iss not classical. The classical view has been that concepts are not accessible to empirical tests. How many people understand, even today, that the concepts of science are neither absolute nor everlasting? And beyond the field of science, in society, in personality, above all in ethics, how many people will allow the sanction of experienced fact? The common view remains the classical view, that the concepts of value -- justice and honour, dignity and tolerance -- have an inwardness which is inaccessible to experience. (37-38)

<h3>William Blake and the Age of Revolution</h3>
<blockquote>It is strange to see that the spread of machines made the men who worked them conscious, first of their own work, and then of themselves as men. Yet this is what the Industrial Revolution did. It forced men in the long run to seek their destiny, and to find their station, not in the hands of God but in their own hands. (5)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The machines changed the organization of society, and shifted the centre of a man's life from his cottage home to the daily factory. In that shift, the man ceased to be a member of his family and his village, and in the long run became simply himself: a person. (5)</blockquote>
<blockquote>We catch in all of them [Smith, Franklin, Rousseau, Jefferson, Burns, Blake, Wordsworth] a new sense that the dignity of man is the simple dignity of labour, and a new image of man the maker. (6)</blockquote>
<blockquote>It will take us time to see that the Industrial Revolution changed the flow of thought and action throughout the West as largely and as deeply as did the Renaissance.... Most deeply, the Industrial Revolution in the long run changed man's conception of himself. (7)</blockquote>
<h3>Magic, Science, and Civilization</h3>
<blockquote>There has been an irreversible step in the cultural evolution of man; it took place at the beginning of the scientific revolution from, say, 1500 to 1700, and it will never be undone. We are committed to a scientific way of thinking and to what it entails, a technological way of acting, and we cannot go back.... Science may be destroyed, our civilization may change its character, but you cannot simply put that evolutionary clock into reverse. The step that was taken in the scientific revolution ... was just as radical as the invention of agriculture, the invention of writing, the invention of poetry and art, or the invention of urban life.... the most remarkable discovery made by scientists is science itself. (2-3)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...the great human revolutions are intellectual revolutions (5)</blockquote>
<blockquote>I am unashamedly an intellectual. Indeed, I know no other way to be a human being. (5)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The central opposition between magic and science is the opposition between power and knowledge. (13)</blockquote>
<blockquote>The subject I have been practicing is called by me "human specificity." And what makes the human species special is, in my view, the crucial link in building a view of the world in which nature and man are really joined into a unity. (15)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...when you look at how human beings do in fact plan, then long-term strategies such as ethics, values, and other forms of behavior become absolutely critical in determining how they shape their lives. (17)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...whereas every other animal fits into an evolutionary niche, man essentially is busy hewing his evolutionary niche out of nature for himself.... the ability of man to make himself and particularly make himself by thought is crucial. (30)</blockquote>
<blockquote>To me, being an intellectual doesn't mean knowing about intellectual issues; it means taking pleasure in them. (36)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...science is a world picture. It is not a technique; it is not a form of power; it is not even simply an accumulation of knowledge. But it is a highly integrated form of knowledge which makes a world view.... Since [the Renaissance] we have been in the unique position of trying to form a single picture of the whole of nature including man. That is a new enterprise; it differs from the preceeding enterprises in that it's not magical, by which I mean that it does not suppose the existence of two logics, a natural logic and a supernatural logic. (39)</blockquote>
<blockquote>[the ideas of Hume, G.E. Moore, and Max Weber] contain the supposition that values must have a different kind of character from the ordinary activity of life. Now this sort of dualism is what I call <em>magic</em>.... It is still present with us all the time in that Cartesian dualism which tries to distinguish between the soul and the body as if they were really separable entities.... only a unitary view will do... any attempt to bifurcate the activities of life and to set up a dualism becomes automatically a kind of magic (64)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...with the coming of secrecy the whole scientific tradition became distorted. The ability to make progress in a natural direction rather than to solve problems in a predestined direction would go. (68-69)</blockquote>
<blockquote>...the great feature of human behavior is that we have strategies by which we direct our lives.... and the name of such an unbounded plan is <em>values (80)</em></blockquote>
<blockquote>We have to establish a unitary sense of the human situation, of the fact that cognitive knowledge is the one thing that human beings have been endowed with. That this has made us the only animal that does not fit into an evolutionary [niche?], but that carves out its own, that makes its physical and mental and cultural enrivonment. And a crucial part of making that cultural environment is to see that the only plan we follow is the great, unbounded, ethical plan of a set of values by which we direct our actions because that's how we are. That is the way to be human. (88)</blockquote>
