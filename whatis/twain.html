<h3>Mark Twain at Monadnock</h3>
<p>At the urging of <a href="/whatis/thayer.html">Abbott Thayer</a> and his wife Emma (a longtime friend of Twain's), Mark Twain spent two unusually productive summers near Mount Monadnock in 1905 and 1906. He enjoyed the company of the creative spirits in the area (which included artist Henry Copley Greene and writer Thomas Wentworth Higginson) and wrote a great deal: poems, short stories such as "A Horse's Tale", drafts of "3,000 Years Among the Microbes" and "The Mysterious Stranger", large stretches of his autobiography, <em>Eve's Diary</em> and related works ("A Monument to Adam" and "A Humane Word from Satan"), polemical works such as "The Czar's Soliloquy", and much of <em>What Is Man?</em>.</p>
