<h3>Monadnock in Reality</h3>
<p>In geology, a monadnock is "a single remnant of a former highland, which rises as an isolated rock mass above a plain" (after <a href="/whatis/picture.html">Mount Monadnock</a>, a 3,165-foot mountain in present-day Cheshire County, New Hampshire). The word 'monadnock' derives from the Western Abenaki 'menonadenak' meaning "smooth mountain", although the term may also carry connotations from 'menadenika' meaning "isolated mountain".</p>
<p>In the realm of the arts, Mount Monadnock, "like a sapphire cloud against the sky" (Hawthorne, <em>American Notebooks</em>, 31 August 1838), inspired a number of significant writers and artists during the American Renaissance and after, including such luminaries as Nathaniel Hawthorne, <a href="/whatis/thoreau.html">Henry David Thoreau</a>, Rudyard Kipling, Willa Cather, <a href="/whatis/robinson.html">Edwin Arlington Robinson</a>, <a href="/whatis/thayer.html">Abbott Thayer</a>, and <a href="/whatis/emerson.html">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> (who called it "the new Olympus").</p>
<p>Elsewhere in reality, the <a href="http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/Monadnock.html" target="_top">Monadnock Building</a> is a fine example of late nineteenth-century architecture right before the dawn of the skyscaper (at one time it was the tallest building in Chicago).  The Monadnock Building was designed by John Root, whose partner Daniel Burnham created The Flatiron Building in New York City (one of your editor's favorite structures).  A contemporary of John Root said of the Monadnock Building that it "tells its story in the plainest, strongest words and then stops talking".  Just the kind of straightforward approach to life we appreciate around here.</p>
