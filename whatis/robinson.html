<h3>Edwin Arlington Robinson at Monadnock</h3>
<p>American poet Edwin Arlington Robinson spent his summers in the years 1911&#150;1934 living in the shadow of Mount Monadnock as a member of the <a href="http://www.macdowellcolony.org/" target="_top">MacDowell Colony</a> in nearby Peterborough. Here is a poem he wrote about the mountain circa 1921:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Monadnock Through the Trees</h4>
<p>Before there was in Egypt any sound<br />
Of those who reared a more prodigious means<br />
For the self-heavy sleep of kings and queens<br />
Than hitherto had mocked the most renowned,&#151;<br />
Unvisioned here and waiting to be found,<br />
Alone, amid remote and older scenes,<br />
You loomed above ancestral evergreens<br />
Before there were the first of us around.
<br /><br />
And when the last of us, if we know how,<br />
See farther from ourselves than we do now,<br />
Assured with other sight than heretofore<br />
That we have done our mortal best and worst,&#151;<br />
Your calm will be the same as when the first<br />
Assyrians went howling south to war.
</p>
