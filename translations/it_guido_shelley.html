<h3>To Guido Cavalcanti</h3>
<p>
Guido, I would that Lapo, thou, and I,<br />
Led by some strong enchantment, might ascend<br />
A magic ship, whose charm&#232;d sails should fly<br />
With winds at will, where'er our thoughts might wend,<br />
And that no change, nor any evil chance,<br />
Should mar our joyous voyage; but it might be<br />
That even satiety should still enhance<br />
Between our hearts their strict community,<br />
And that the bounteous wizard then would place<br />
Vanna and Bice and my gentle love,<br />
Companions of our wandering, and would grace<br />
With passionate talk, wherever we might rove,<br />
Our time, and each were as content and free<br />
As I believe that thou and I should be.
