<h3>From "Canticle of the Creatures"</h3>
<p>
Be praised my Lord, even for each stone,<br />
and specially for sir our brother sun,<br />
who lights the day and makes you known<br />
by his fair splendor shining down.
</p>
<p>
Be praised my Lord for sister moon, and for the arching<br />
night you made to sparkle with your stars.
</p>
<p>
Be praised my Lord for brother wind<br />
and all the weathers, stormy and serene,<br />
by which your creatures are sustained.
</p>
<p>
Be praised my Lord for sister water: she is dear<br />
and useful, modest, chaste and pure.
</p>
<p>
Be praised my Lord for brother fire, our mighty<br />
friend by whom we're warmed and see at night,<br />
and he is beautiful, and strong, and gives delight.
</p>
<p>
Be praised my Lord for sister mother earth,<br />
who feeds and governs us, and brings us forth<br />
her fruit and colored flowers of high worth.
