<h3>Falconry</h3>
<p>
A prince survives by unseen acts.<br />
At night the chief advisor knocked<br />
at Frederick's workroom in the tower<br />
and found him formulating facts<br />
for treatises on wing&#232;d power<br />
while his penman turned out text.
</p>
<p>
It was in this aerie room<br />
he'd walked all night with <em>her</em> on arm,<br />
turbulent and barely fledged.<br />
Whatever plans then sprang to mind,<br />
whatever fondness deeply chimed<br />
in recollection he would trash<br />
and tend the frightened and impassioned<br />
thing he wished to understand.<br />
Every night he made a time<br />
for nothing but the young unhandled<br />
animal. It was her staring<br />
inborn mind he'd worked to learn,
</p>
<p>
so he was lofted with her grace<br />
when she, the bird that nobles praise,<br />
thrown gleaming from his hand (her wingbeats raised<br />
into the heartfelt morning air)<br />
and diving like an angel struck the hern.
