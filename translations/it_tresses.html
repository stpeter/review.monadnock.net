<h3>She let her sunlit tresses fly</h3>
<p>
She let her sunlit tresses fly,<br />
tangled and golden in the air.<br />
Unmeasurable light was in her eyes &#151;<br />
how fine they were! &#151; and now that look is rare.<br />
Her kndness showed in tender glances &#151;<br />
wind-flushed cheeks. At least that's how it seemed.<br />
I was walking tinder, I took chances.<br />
The next part might be something that I dreamed:
</p>
<p>
A fiery lightness in her bearing,<br />
a voice that wasn't mortal &#151; it was song,<br />
a sort of angel presence she was wearing.<br />
She was a thing from heaven. If I'm wrong<br />
I'd just as soon not know.<br />
To heal the wound you don't unstring the bow.
