<h3>If I were fire, I'd burn up the world</h3>
<p>
If I were fire, I'd burn up the world;<br />
if I were storm, I'd raise a giant swell<br />
and drown it all; if I were God I'd hurl<br />
this rat's-ass circus all the way to hell.<br />
If I were pope, how happy I would be!<br />
I'd cheat the Christians blind and suck their blood.<br />
To serve as emperor I might agree,<br />
so I could chop off everybody's head.<br />
If I were Death, I'd go to see my dad &#151;<br />
of course with mother I would do the same.<br />
If I were Life, I'd run from them like mad.<br />
If I were Cecco, as indeed I am,<br />
I'd take the lovely and the lively dames<br />
and leave for you the ugly and the sad.
