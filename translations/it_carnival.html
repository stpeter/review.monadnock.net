<h3>Carnival Song</h3>
<p>
Though they're all the joy we know,<br />
youth and beauty don't endure.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
Here's the Wine God and his Lady:<br />
see how they admire each other!<br />
They know time is brief and flighty,<br />
so they spend it well together.<br />
All these nymphs and other gentry,<br />
to enjoy themselves know how.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
Satyrs here are happy, clearly,<br />
they are waiting in the bushes<br />
for the nymphs they love so dearly,<br />
who expect their ardent rushes.<br />
Gulping as the wineskin gushes,<br />
jumping, dancing anyhow,<br />
if you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
And the nymphs seem not to worry,<br />
they have found they like the satyrs,<br />
(who in fact are rather furry<br />
but that makes their pleasure greater).<br />
They are pairing up for later<br />
and their faces are aglow.<br />
If you want be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
Fat Silenus, Baccus' friend,<br />
like a sack with pointed ears,<br />
on assback since too drunk to stand,<br />
shows his ancient wrinkled leer.<br />
Full of wine and flesh and years,<br />
he is cheerful anyhow.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
Midas throws his coins about &#151;<br />
all turns gold beneath his touch.<br />
Why the disappointed pout?<br />
Metal doesn't please him much.<br />
Thirsty (can't drink gold as such),<br />
starving, he could eat a cow.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
Now hear this with open ears:<br />
we can't live on future plans;<br />
it's today that we are here,<br />
youngster, oldster, woman, man.<br />
Put your sorrows under ban<br />
and let's party anyhow.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.
</p>
<p>
You young dancers in the ring,<br />
hail to Wine and hail Desire!<br />
Let's have music and let's sing,<br />
never tiring, stepping higher.<br />
Yes to sweetness, to the fire<br />
that our courtesy allows.<br />
If you want, be happy now;<br />
for tomorrow's never sure.<br />
Though they're all the joy we know,<br />
youth and beauty don't endure.
