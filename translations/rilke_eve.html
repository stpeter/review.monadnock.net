<h3>Eve</h3>
<p>
Not heeding what would be a dizzy climb,<br />
Aloft by the cathedral's stained-glass rose,<br />
She stands with apple in the apple pose:<br />
Innocent and guilty for all time
</p>
<p>
Of all the growing and the giving birth<br />
Since her emergence from eternity.<br />
(Since she went striding forth so lovingly,<br />
Like the young springtime striving in the earth.)
</p>
<p>
She would have gladly lingered in that land,<br />
Sharing with beasts a sense of what is best,<br />
Each with a wisdom after its own kind.
</p>
<p>
But when she saw the man make up his mind<br />
She went with him. They sought death as a quest &#151;<br />
And life had then just barely touched her hand.
