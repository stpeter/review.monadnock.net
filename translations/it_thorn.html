<h3>The thorn forest</h3>
<p>
Then dark with dripping blood it gave a howl<br />
and cried again: "Our damaged branches ache!<br />
Your pillage maims me! Can't you feel at all?
</p>
<p>
We who were men are now this barren brake.<br />
You'd grant us your respect and stay your hand<br />
were we a thicket not of souls but snakes."
</p>
<p>
As wood still green starts burning at one end<br />
and from its unlit end the burning stick<br />
drips sap, and hisses with escaping wind,
</p>
<p>
so from the broken stump there oozed a mix<br />
of words and blood: a frothy babbling gore.<br />
I dropped the branch. My fear had made me sick.
</p>
<p>
"Poor wounded soul, could he have grasped before,"<br />
my sage replied, "what now he sees is true,<br />
and blindly trusted in poetic lore,
</p>
<p>
then he need not have so insulted you.<br />
But as there was no other way to learn<br />
I urged him to a test that grieved me too.
</p>
<p>
Tell us who you were, that he, in turn,<br />
can set your honor freshly back in style<br />
among those he will teach when he returns."
</p>
<p>
The trunk: "Your speech, by raising hope that I'll<br />
regain repute, makes words arise in me.<br />
I mean to talk, if you will stay a while:
</p>
<p>
I was the one entrusted with the keys<br />
to Federigo's mind, and it was sweet<br />
to share his thought and guard his strategy
</p>
<p>
for noble ventures secret in my keep &#151;<br />
so faithfully I filled this glorious post,<br />
I gladly sacrificed my health and sleep..."
