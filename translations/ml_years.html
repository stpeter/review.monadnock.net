<h3>From "Where are my years?"</h3>
<p>
Where are my years? They've vanished past reclaim.<br />
Has life been real for me, or just a dream?<br />
The world I took for solid, was it so?<br />
Perhaps I merely slept, and didn't know.<br />
And now that I'm awake I've lost the strands<br />
of what was once familiar as my hand.<br />
My people, and the country where I grew,<br />
my neighborhood &#151; all strange, as if untrue.<br />
The fields are burned, the forest has been felled,<br />
my boyhood playmates have grown old and dull.<br />
They greet me coldly who were gracious once;<br />
the forms of courtesy are now affronts.<br />
Were not the brooks still running as they were,<br />
my frame of mind would be too much to bear.<br />
I can recall so many joyous days<br />
now blown away, like seafoam off the waves.
