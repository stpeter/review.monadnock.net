<h3>I thought I'd served her long enough</h3>
<p>
I thought I'd served her long enough,<br />
and sat dejected and confused<br />
despairing of the lady's love,<br />
when something gave my hopes a boost.<br />
You'll laugh at me (it seems so small,<br />
more of a consolation prize)<br />
for taking comfort there at all;<br />
but I could feel my fortunes rise.
</p>
<p>
What cheered me was a blade of grass:<br />
I measured out a stalk I'd plucked<br />
(as children do to learn their luck)<br />
and it said she'd offer me her grace.<br />
Listen and judge if you think she might:<br />
"She will, she won't, she will, she won't, she will."<br />
As much as I've tried it, it's come out right,<br />
but you have to trust in the grass's skill.
