<h3>The Statue</h3>
<p>
If it did, it happened like this:<br />
The crowd assembled, filled up the entire palace.<br />
And line after line stood, joined together, <br />
In the broad space of the porch and the court,<br />
In rows and rows of erect figures,<br />
Between the carved pillars of red marble,<br />
On the expanded marble stairs &#151;<br />
Built over hewn stones &#151; and on the slope<br />
Of the hill, adorned with olive trees.
</p>
<p>
Among them were the fastidious sons of Hellada, <br />
Earthly corn-dealers from Malta<br />
And from the other remote islands of the sea which<br />
Were a part of Asia; from Cyprus,<br />
And spear-loving men from Sparta,<br />
And goat-shepherds from Arcadia,<br />
And hard, sturdy Macedonians,<br />
All gathered and came from the ends of Greece,<br />
And from Magna Graecia in Italy: All came<br />
As one man to the inauguration of the monument &#151;<br />
Of the statue of Zeus &#151; for long<br />
The rumor was spread, nowhere in the world<br />
Was the likeness of that wondrous statue.
</p>
<p>
And it seemed, under the beams of the sunlight,<br />
That the silent, erect pillars stood<br />
Alive, in the warmth of flesh and blood,<br />
And softly, secretly, the garlands caressed them<br />
Like tiaras: dark-green ivy, <br />
And roses: orange, blood red,<br />
Pale-white and blushing-pink.
</p>
<p>
And majestically festive, impatient, the crowd<br />
Was waiting &#151; all the people.  And the cloud of incense<br />
Was rising, and lo!  It floated upward. <br />
And light-blue clouds, on hazy wings,<br />
Lightly rose, and expanded, and rose,<br />
And united &#151; and the curtain stirred.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly, from within the incense, it was disclosed &#151;<br />
Within the curling, mounting cloud &#151;<br />
An unearthly, splendorous vision appeared,<br />
The marvel of Greece, the shield-holder's face.<br />
The ivory body was alive in immortal, eternal beauty,<br />
In immeasurable valor, in the harmony and blossoming prime<br />
Of a man-god's power.  Over his face a halo,<br />
He boasted his wondrous strength, the abundant<br />
Presence of eternal joy and grace.
</p>
<p>
The greatest grace of the world's creator, the maker of all,<br />
Was reflected in his eyes and lighted <br />
The face of the father of the gods and man.<br />
His locks overflowed from his magnificent head,<br />
A Southern storm resided in his entangled eyebrows,<br />
Terrible in their might.  His whole being was serene majesty,<br />
Generous spirit and tranquil nobility.<br />
All the people froze in mute joy,<br />
They stood dumbfounded, silent and thrilled.<br />
Suddenly they stirred, and line after line,<br />
Man after man bowed and fell<br />
To his knees, and like the roaring sea,<br />
The sound of the astounded people rose, their joy,<br />
Their ecstasy: "Kalos! Kalos! Kalos!"
</p>
<p>
But among all the kneeling people,<br />
Crying out in fervor and wonder,<br />
There was only one who did not kneel before the god,<br />
And did not bend his proud, noble head.<br />
Silent, pale, he stood among the crowd,<br />
And something bitter seemed to curve his lips.<br />
Only one remained standing erect,<br />
And that one was &#151; the statue's creator.
</p>
<p>
The wondrous statue's creator alone, he alone, did not kneel,<br />
And did not bend his noble, proud head,<br />
And remained standing, only he &#151; because:<br />
Seeing the god's face, its enchanting glory,<br />
Seeing its pure, godly beauty &#151;<br />
Suddenly God's face appeared before his eyes,<br />
Exceeding it in beauty,<br />
Still purer, still godlier than it &#151;<br />
Like the phantom that hovered before his eyes,<br />
Like the image that haunted him,<br />
The mysterious vision of his creation,<br />
When his dream was devised and inspired<br />
His imagination, in the pain of the creator's pangs,<br />
In the bitter tears of impotent despair,<br />
And in the intoxicated victory of the conqueror of matter &#151;<br />
Till God was created and still was an ideal...
