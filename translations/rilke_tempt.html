<h3>The Temptation of St. Anthony</h3>
<p>
It didn't help for him to drive the quills<br />
Of porcupines into his lecher's flesh &#151;<br />
His pandemonian senses uttered shrill<br />
Expulsive cries and issued him a fresh
</p>
<p>
Supply of freaks: Crawling, flitting sights'<br />
Ill-fitting heads, whose squints and leers distort<br />
Their teeming faces, glint-eyed with delight,<br />
Crowding in around him for their sport.
</p>
<p>
Fruitful at night, his senses spawned like flies<br />
Clustered on dung. Their hatchlings' breeding place,<br />
His body, waved with brightly speckled lies<br />
That coalesced to whispers of disgrace.<br />
Unwanted pleasure would dissolve his face<br />
Into a drinking pool that filled with eyes<br />
And he, as shadows opened up their thighs,<br />
Handled and warm, awake to his embrace,
</p>
<p>
Screamed for the angel, screamed without restraint.<br />
The angel, trailing glory from above,<br />
Arrived, was there, and then contrived to shove<br />
The difficulties back into the saint.
</p>
<p>
So he could struggle, inwardly tormented<br />
By beasts and demons, as he had for years,<br />
And somehow God, an essence far from clear,<br />
Could be distilled from what the saint fermented.
