<h3>Ulysses' last voyage</h3>
<p>
I launched her with my small remaining band<br />
and, putting out to sea, we set the main<br />
on that lone ship and said farewell to land.
</p>
<p>
Far to starboard rose the coast of Spain,<br />
astern was Sardi, Islas at our bow,<br />
and soon we saw Morocco port abeam.
</p>
<p>
Though I and comrades now were old and slow,<br />
we hauled till nightfall for the narrow sound<br />
where Hercules had shown what not to do,
</p>
<p>
by setting marks for men to stay behind.<br />
At dawn the starboard lookout made Seville,<br />
and at the straits stood Ceuta t'other hand.
</p>
<p>
"Brothers," I shouted, "who have had the will<br />
to come through danger, and have reached the west!<br />
our time awake is brief from now until
</p>
<p>
the senses die, and so I say we test<br />
the sun's own motion and do not forego<br />
the worlds beyond, unknown and peopleless.
</p>
<p>
Think of the roots from which you sprang, and show<br />
that you are human: not unconscious brutes<br />
but made to follow virtue and to <em>know</em>."
