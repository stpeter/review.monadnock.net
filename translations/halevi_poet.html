<h3>The Poet</h3>
<p>
His annals were completely amiss.<br />
His hopes sank down an abyss.
</p>
<p>
He was far from his mother and father,<br />
His day was the wolves' to devour.
</p>
<p>
A great wind came and smashed his abode.<br />
Time drove away his girl and boy.
</p>
<p>
And when sorrows could not be surpassed &#151;<br />
He tunefully cried out Alas!
</p>
<p>
And then waited and waited,<br />
To be praised:<br />
How well you lamented!
