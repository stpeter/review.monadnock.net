<h3>The Stylite</h3>
<p>
He nearly drowned in hermit-seeking seas<br />
Of visitors &#151; those voids he had allowed<br />
To suck his soul &#151; damned sycophantic fleas!<br />
Wrenching himself from the besieging crowd,<br />
He gripped with clammy hands and bulbous knees
</p>
<p>
And climbed a column standing idle there.<br />
Alone, on top of it, his spirit soared,<br />
And once again he started to compare<br />
His weakness with the strength that is the Lord.
</p>
<p>
No end to it: as fast as he could praise<br />
The Other grew, and overtopped it all.<br />
Rustics, stopping near the foot to gaze,<br />
Would see a lonely madman, high and small,
</p>
<p>
In lively conversation with the sky.<br />
The howls came plunging down for them to hear<br />
When rainy weather screened him from their eyes.<br />
He seemed to pray by shouting in their ears<br />
And yet he didn't realize for years
</p>
<p>
That, all this while, his following had grown.<br />
Around the column, seating was set out<br />
For pious tourist, amateur devout &#151;<br />
The column had more glamour than a throne.
</p>
<p>
But as he battled with his daily fiends,<br />
Crying aloud, so mortified by them,<br />
Despairing of a way to make them go,<br />
The maggots, which had fattened up of late,<br />
Dropped from his wounds upon the foremost row<br />
Of those by whom he felt himself demeaned:<br />
There to festoon the princely diadem<br />
And pupate in the velvet robes of state.
