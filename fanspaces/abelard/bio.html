<h3>About Peter Abelard</h3>
<p>Here are some recommended resources for exploring the life, times, and ideas of Peter Abelard:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best biography is <a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0631214445')">Abelard: A Medieval Life</a> by M.T. Clanchy</li>
<li>A shorter treatment available on the web is this <a href="http://www.knight.org/advent/cathen/01036b.htm" target="_parent">article</a> from the Catholic Encyclopedia</li>
<li>Abelard's autobiographical <em>Historia Calamitatum</em> is another good source (an <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/abelard-sel.html" target="_parent">excerpt</a> is available on the web)</li>
<li><a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0140442979')">The Letters of Abelard and Heloise</a> are quite powerful and are usually bundled together with the <em>Historia Calamitatum</em></li>
<li>I enjoyed this <a href="http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/anthropoetics/views/view13.htm" target="_parent">essay</a> on Abelard and Heloise by Eric Gans</li>
</ul>
<p>Abelard's story, especially the story of his love affair with Heloise, has inspired quite a few artists over the centuries (from Alexander Pope to poets, playwrights, and novelists of the 20th century). Here is a sampling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pope's poem <a href="/poems/eloisa.html">Eloisa to Abelard</a>, an answer to which was supplied by my friend Roger Donway in his poem <a href="/poems/abelard.html">Abelard to Heloise</a>
<li><a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0883472171')">Peter Abelard</a>, a novel by Helen Waddell (out of print but not hard to find in good used book stores)</li>
<li><a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0573010137')">Abelard and Heloise</a>, a play by Ronald Millar based heavily on Waddell's novel</li>
<li><a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('1569470111')">Stealing Heaven</a> by Marion Meade, which was also made into a fairly good film</li>
<li><a href="http://rage.ipdinc.com/index.htm" target="_parent">Rage of the Heart</a>, a musical by Enrico Garzilli (unfortunately the CD seems to be out of print); see also Astrid Ostheimer's <a href="http://www.rz.uni-frankfurt.de/~aostheim/roth/" target="_parent">unofficial Rage of the Heart website</a></li>
<li><a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0674001001')">Abelard</a>, a book-length poem by Cedric Whitman</li>
</ul>
