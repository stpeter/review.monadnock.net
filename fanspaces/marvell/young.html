<h2>Young Love, by Andrew Marvell</h2>
<p>
Come, little infant, love me now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thine unsuspected years<br />
Clear thine ag&#232;d father's brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From cold jealousy and fears.<br />
</p>
<p>
Pretty, surely, 'twere to see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By young love old time beguiled,<br />
While our sportings are as free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the nurse's with the child.
</p>
<p>
Common beauties stay fifteen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as yours should swifter move,<br />
Whose fair blossoms are too green<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet for lust, but not for love.
</p>
<p>
Love as much the snowy lamb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the wanton kid, does prize,<br />
As the lusty bull or ram,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his morning sacrifice.
</p>
<p>
Now then love me: time may take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee before they time away:<br />
Of this need we'll virtue make,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn love before we may.
</p>
<p>
So we win of doubtful fate;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if good she to us meant,<br />
We that good shall antedate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if ill, that ill prevent.
</p>
<p>
Thus as kingdoms, frustrating<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other titles to their crown,<br />
In the cradle crown their king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So all foreign claims to drown,
</p>
<p>
So, to make all rivals vain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I crown thee with my love:<br />
Crown me with thy love again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we both shall monarchs prove.
