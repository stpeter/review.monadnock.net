<h1>Kay Nolte Smith FanSpace</h1>
<p>This FanSpace is closing down along with its parent site, the Monadnock Review. Those interested in Kay Nolte Smith would do well to read an <a href="http://www.presenceofmind.net/GSW/KNT.html">essay</a> about her by Greg Swann, or visit <a href="http://www.laissezfairebooks.com">Laissez Faire Books</a>. Unfortunately, there are very few other resources about Ms. Smith available on the Internet.</p> 
<!--
<p>Kay Nolte Smith (1932&#150;1993) was a fine if lesser-known novelist who won an Edgar Allan Poe Award for her first novel (<em>The Watcher</em>) and grew as a writer with each of her subsequent publications. </p>
<p>The following books were created by Kay Nolte Smith before her untimely death:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Watcher (1980; winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best first novel)</li>
<li>Catching Fire (1982)</li>
<li>Mindspell (1983)</li>
<li>Elegy for a Soprano (1985)</li>

</ul>
<p>Sadly, only the first and the last of these are in print (the first from Pulpless.com via <a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('158445153X')">Amazon.com</a>, the last from <a href="http://www.laissezfaire.org/" target="_parent">Laissez-Faire Books</a>). However, you can probably find copies from the various purveyors of used books on the web, such as <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/" target="_top">abebooks.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bibliofind.com/">bibliofind.com</a>.</p>
