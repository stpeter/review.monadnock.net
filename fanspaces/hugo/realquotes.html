That is an account he will have to settle. He can be guilty; and that &#151; it is a striking fact, and one upon which I insist &#151; is his greatness." (VI.7)
<p>"There are axioms in probity, in honesty, in justice, just as much as there are axioms in geometry; and the truths of morality are no more at the mercy of a vote than are the truths of algebra." (VI.8)</p>
<p>"The future has become possible." (VII.2)</p>
<p>"Providence, by the mere fact of universal life, leads men, things, and events on to maturity. In order that an old world fade away, it is sufficient for civilization, ascending majestically toward her solstice, to illuminate ancient institutions, ancient prejudices, ancient laws, and ancient manners. Her radiance burns up the past and devours it. Civilization enlightens (this is the visible fact) and at the same time consumes (this is the mysterious fact). Under its influence, that which should decline declines, and that which should grow old grows old, slowly and without shock; wrinkles come to things condemned, be they castes, or codes, or institutions, or religions."

<p>"He who abandons the field is beaten." (II.1.iv)</p>
<p>"The daylight of history is merciless; it has the strange and magical quality that, although it is composed of light, and precisely because of this, it casts shadows where once only brilliance was to be seen, making of one man two images, each opposed to the other, so that the darkness of the despot counteracts the majesty of the leader. The the world arrives at a more balanced judgment." (II.1.iv)</p>
<p>"They are illustrious because they think." (II.1.xvi)</p>

(III.1.xi)</p>
<p>"To be 'ultra' is to go to the extreme. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the altar; to abuse the cause one supports; to rush one's fences, outdo the executioner in the grilling of heretics, charge the idol with insufficient idolatry, insult by excessive adulation, find the pope insufficiently papist and the king insufficiently royalist. It is to denigrate the whiteness of alabaster or snow or the swan or the lily in the name of flawless whiteness; to be a partisan of causes to the point of becoming their enemy; to be so vehemently <em>for</em> as to be in fact <em>against</em>."

<p>"The conflict between Right and Fact goes back to the dawn of society. To bring it to an end, uniting the pure thought with human reality, peacefully causing Right to pervade Fact and Fact to be embedded in Right, this is the task of wise men." (IV.1.i)</p>

<p>"To learn to read is to light a fire; every syllable that is spelled out is a spark." (IV.7.i)</p>
<p>"Intellectual and moral growth is no less essential than material betterment. Knowledge is a viaticum; thought is a primary necessity; truth is as much a source of nourishment as corn.

<p>"There must be extravagance in happiness; rapture must be spiced with superfluity.... Happiness unadorned is like unbuttered bread: one may eat it but one does not dine." (V.5.vi)</p>
<p>"The philosophers say, 'Be moderate in your pleasures,' but I say enjoy them to the full.... Moderate your pleasures &#151; what nonsense it is! Down with the philosophers! Rapture is the true wisdom." (V.6.ii)</p>
<p>"The circumstances of happiness are not enough, there must be peace of mind." (V.7.iv)</p>
<p>"To die is nothing; but it is terrible not to live." (V.9.v)</p>

<a name="1864"></a><h3>William Shakespeare (1864)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"God manifests himself to us in the first degree through the life of the universe, and in the second degree through the thought of man. The second manifestation is not less holy than the first. The first is named Nature, the second is named Art." (I.2.i)</p>
<p>"Homer is one of the men of genius who solve that fine problem of art &#151; the finest of all, perhaps &#151; truly to depict humanity by the enlargement of man: that is, to generate the real in the ideal." (I.2.ii, &#167;1)</p>
<p>"It is man's consolation that the future is to be a sunrise instead of a sunset." (I.2.ii, &#167;5)</p>
<p>"Wisdom in the beginning, reason by and by: such is the strange history of the human mind." (I.2.ii, &#167;13)</p>

<p>"... the possible: that window of the dream opening upon reality." (I.2.ii, &#167;14)</p>
<p>"Music expresses that which cannot be said and on which it is impossible to remain silent." (I.2.iv)</p>
<p>"The book is vaster yet than that grand scene, the world; for to the fact it adds the idea." (I.3.i)</p>

<p>"A counting-house passes away; a school endures." (I.4.ix)</p>

<p>"Genius is a headland jutting out into the infinite." (II.2.v)</p>
<p>"Night is but the night of the world; evil is the night of the soul." (II.2.vi)</p>
<p>"The school is the resultant of pedantry; the school is the literary excrescence of the budget; the school is intellectual mandarinship governing in the various authorized and official teachings, either of the press or of the state, from the theatrical <em>feuilleton</em> of the prefecture to the biographies and encyclopedias duly examined and stamped and hawked about, and made sometimes, by way of refinement, by republicans agreeable to the police; the school is the classic and scholastic orthodoxy, with its unbroken girdle of walls, Homeric and Virgilian antiquity traded upon by official and licensed <em>literati</em> &#151; a sort of China calling itself Greece; the school is, summed up in one concretion which forms part of public order, all the knowledge of pedagogues, all the history of historiographers, all the poetry of laureates, all the philosophy of sophists, all the criticism of pedants, all the ferules of the teaching friars, all the religion of bigots, all the modesty of prudes, all the metaphysics of partisans, all the justice of bureaucrats, all the old age of dapper young men bereft of their virility, all the flattery of courtiers, all the diatribes of censer-bearers, all the independence of flunkeys, all the certitudes of the short-sighted and of base souls."

<a name="1866"></a><h3>Les Travailleurs de la Mer (The Toilers of the Sea, 1866)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Religion, society, nature: these are the three struggles of man. These three conflicts are, at the same time, his three needs: it is necessary for him to believe, hence the temple; it is necessary for him to create, hence the city; it is necessary for him to live, hence the plow and the ship. But these three solutions contain three conflicts. The mysterious difficulty of life springs from all three. Man has to deal with obstacles under the form of superstition, under the form of prejudice, and under the form of the elements. A triple <em>ananke</em> [necessity] weighs upon us: the <em>ananke</em> of dogmas, the <em>ananke</em> of laws, and the <em>ananke</em> of things.... With these three fatalities which envelop man is mingled the interior fatality, that supreme <em>ananke</em>, the human heart." (Preface)</p>
<p>"The great outlines and the great sublimity of nature &#151; the cradle of the ocean, the profile of the mountains, the shade of the forests, the blue of the heavens &#151; are composed of elements of intense discord mingled harmoniously together." (The Channel Islands, &#167;vi)</p>
<p>"As long as the past has breath enough to make itself heard, Voltaire will be rejected. Listen to all these opinions: He has neither genius, nor talent, nor wit. When old he was insulted; when dead he was outlawed. He is everlastingly "discussed"; in that his glory consists. Is it possible to speak of Voltaire with calmness and justice? When a man rules an age and embodies progress, he is no longer the subject of criticism, but of hatred." (The Channel Islands, &#167;x)</p>
<p>"... the habit of reading ... produces dignity of manners." (The Channel Islands, &#167;xiii)</p>
<p>"... custom ... is more despotic than law." (The Channel Islands, &#167xvii)</p>
<p>"It seems that a certain power of achievement is given to man. He appropriates creation to human needs. Such is his function. He has the audacity necessary to accomplish it; one might also say the impiety.... Man, this short-lived being, this creature always surrounded by death, undertakes the infinite.... He has his idea of fitness; the universe must accept it. Besides, has he not a universe of his own? He expects to make of it what seems to him good. A universe is raw material. The world, work of God, is man's canvas. Everything restrains man, but nothing stops him. He overcomes limits by jumping over them. The impossible is a perpetually receding frontier.... Formerly he took all this trouble for Xerxes; today, less foolish, he takes the trouble for himself. This diminution of stupidity is called progress." (The Channel Islands, &#167;xx)</p>
<p>"Volcanoes cast forth stones, and revolutions cast forth men." (I.1.iii)</p>
<p>"Solitude generates a certain quality of sublime exaltation." (I.1.vii)</p>
<p>"The human body might well be regarded as only an appearance. It hides our reality. It lies thick over our light, or our shadow. The reality is our soul. To speak absolutely, the human visage is a mask. The true man is that which is beneath man." (I.3.i)</p>
<p>"... the beautiful is a necessity.... To scatter joy, to beam with happiness, to possess amid sombre things an exhalation of light, to be the gilding of destiny, to be harmony, to be grace, to be prettiness, is to render a service. Beauty does one good by being beautiful." (I.3.i)</p>
<p>"By virtue of being a philosopher, he lacked somewhat in wisdom." (I.3.xii)</p>
<p>"The intolerance of the tolerant exists, as well as the rage of the moderates." (I.3.xii)</p>
<p>"One can derive good from a knowledge of evil." (I.5.ii)</p>
<p>"The exaggeration of fright deprives facts of their true proportions." (I.5.ii)</p>
<p>"Forces are infinite machines, machines are limited forces." (I.6.iii)</p>
<p>"No force is blind. Man must watch these forces, and seek to discover their laws." (I.6.iii)</p>
<p>"An idea is a meteor; at the moment of success, the accumulated meditations which have preceded it open a little, and a spark flashes forth from it...." (I.6.vi)</p>
<p>"To plan and to execute are two different things, and the proof is, that it is easy to dream but difficult to perform." (I.7.i)</p>
<p>"In certain vast enterprises when the superhuman seems necessary, bravery is little less than madness." (I.7.i)</p>
<p>About Gilliatt (the hero): "He added to strength, which is physical, energy, which is moral force." (II.1.vii)</p>
<p>Gilliatt was "profoundly thoughtful during his labor". (II.1.ix)</p>
<p>"To force an obstacle into service is a great stride towards triumph." (II.1.x)</p>
<p>"The works of nature, no less supreme than the works of genius, contain something of the absolute..." (II.1.xiii)</p>
<p>"Nothing equals the timidity of ignorance, except its temerity. When ignorance sets out but to dare, it is because it has a compass within it. This compass is the intuition of the true, often more clear in a simple than in an enlightened mind.... all this detracts nothing from science, which remains the rule. The ignorant man may discover, the learned man alone invents." (II.2.ii)</p>
<p>"He did things which appeared useless &#151; a sign of attentive forethought." (II.2.iii)</p>
<p>"A superb flame is the visible will. The eye of man is so made that one perceives his virtue in it. Our eyes reveal the quantity of man there is in us. We assert ourselves by the light which lies under our eyelids. Small consciences blink their eyes, great ones dart lightning. If nothing glows beneath the lids, it is because nothing in the brain thinks, nothing in the heart loves." (II.2.iv)</p>
<p>"Nearly the whole secret of great hearts lies in this word, <em>perseverando</em>. Perseverance is to courage what the wheel is to the lever, it is the perpetual renewing of the fulcrum." (II.2.iv)</p>
<p>"Exhaustion of strength does not exhaust the will. Faith is only a secondary power, to will is the first. The proverbial mountains which faith moves are nothing beside that which the will accomplishes." (II.2.iv)</p>

<p>"One should never tire of insisting on the unity of the laws of nature; it reveals the unity of being." (II.3.iii)</p>
<p>"Phenomena may well be suspected of anything, are capable of anything. Hypothesis proclaims the infinite; that is what gives hypothesis its greatness. Beneath the surface fact it seeks the real fact. It asks creation for her thoughts, and then for her second thoughts. The great scientific discoverers are those who hold nature suspect." (II.3.iii)</p>
<p>"Navigation is education. The sea is a hard school. Cohabitation with these unmanageable phenomena produces a rough race of men who deserve to be cherished: the mariners. There are no other conquerors but them. Ulysses the voyager accomplishes more than Achilles the fighter." (II.3.iii)</p>
<p>"Navigation is the opposite of war. Navigation civilizes barbarism, war barbarizes civilization." (II.3.iii)</p>
<p>"Let us never forget, the best is found only by the better." (II.4.ii)</p>
<p>"Life is the voyage, the idea is the itinerary." (III.1.i)</p>
