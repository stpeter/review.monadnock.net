<h2>Quotes Attributed to Victor Hugo</h2>
<p>I'm not sure if all these quotes are truly the words of Victor Hugo, but I like the thoughts contained therein. (I have started a page for <a href="realquotes.html">verified quotes</a> and am moving quotes from here to there as I locate them in Hugo's writings.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My tastes are aristocratic, my actions democratic.</p>
<p>He who opens a school door, closes a prison.</p>
<p>Common sense is in spite of, not the result of, education.</p>
<p>People do not lack strength; they lack will.</p>
<p>Initiative is doing the right thing without being told.</p>
<p>Those who live are those who fight.</p>
<p>Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause.</p>
<p>Forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age.</p>
<p>Faithful to the engagement that I have made with my conscience, I shall live to the end the exile of liberty. When liberty returns, I shall return.</p>
<p>Winter is on my head, but eternal spring is in my heart; I breathe at this hour the fragrance of the lilacs, the violets, and the roses, as at twenty years ago. The nearer I approach to the end, the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me.</p>
