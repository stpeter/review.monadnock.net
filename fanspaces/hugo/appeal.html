<h2>An Appeal for Translations</h2>
<p>February 26, 2002 will be the 200th anniversary of Victor Hugo's birth. Yet, despite Hugo's evident popularity, the only writings of his that are readily available in English translation are <em>Les Mis&#233;rables</em> (1862) and <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em> (1831). Where are <em>The Toilers of the Sea</em> (1866), <em>The Man Who Laughs</em> (1869), <em>Ninety-Three</em> (1874), <em>The History of a Crime</em> (1877-8), let alone his poems and essays? These magnificent works are effectively unknown to English speakers (excepting those who spend their days haunting used-book stores, and even then most of the translations one finds are hopelessly out of date).</p>
<p>I suggest that this situation be remedied through new translations of Hugo's works or, failing that, re-publication of existing translations. For example, The Heritage Press (39 E. 72nd Street, New York, NY, 10021) published a translation of <em>The Toilers of the Sea</em> in 1961, and Bantam Books (1540 Broadway, New York, NY 10036, or <a href="mailto:bantampublicity@randomhouse.com">bantampublicity@randomhouse.com</a>) published a translation of <em>Ninety-Three</em> in 1962. Re-publication of these works in time for the Hugo bicentennial would seem eminently feasible, and if you love the writings of Victor Hugo I ask you to contact these publishers and others (e.g, Penguin Books, which has published both <em>Les Mis&#233;reables</em> and <em>Notre-Dame de Paris</em>), encouraging them to make more of Hugo's writings available in English. </p>
<p>Merci!</p>
