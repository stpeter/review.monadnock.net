<!--
<p>Welcome to the wonderful worlds of James P. Hogan. His novel <a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0312862431')">Outward Bound</a> is now available in hardcover. We're celebrating here at the <a href="/" target="_top">Monadnock Review</a> by publishing a <a href="outward_01.html">review</a> of it by Paul Beaird and a contrasting <a href="outward_02.html">review</a> by Peter Saint-Andr&#233;. And since <em>Outward Bound</em> came out he's also published <a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0671578138')">Cradle of Saturn</a>, which may be his best novel yet!</p>
<p>The prolific Mr. Hogan is also working on an explosive book entitled <em>Truth Under Tyranny: Science's Heresies and Impermissable Thoughts</em>, which he reports "all the publishers approached so far have liked but confessed themselves too nervous to publish". However, you don't have to wait for some daring publisher to act before you expose yourself to the kinds of tough questions Mr. Hogan is asking, because he has been kind enough to share the book proposal with the readers of this website. So open your mind, fasten your seatbelt, and make sure you're sitting down before you <a href="truth_01.html">read on</a>! (Mr. Hogan's article <a href="heresy.html">AIDS Heresy and the New Bishops</a>, a detailed version of one chapter in the book proposal for <em>Truth Under Tyranny</em>, is also available on this site. Parts of this <em>Truth Under Tyranny</em> seem to have been smuggled into his book <a href="javascript:GoToAmazon('0671578073')">Rockets, Redheads, and Revolutions</a>.)</p>
<p>While you're at it, don't neglect to visit the <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/" target="_top">Official James P. Hogan Page</a> &#151; I especially enjoy the <a href="http://www.jamesphogan.com/bb.html" target="_parent">Bulletin Board</a> containing Mr. Hogan's latest thoughts on scientific topics.</p>
