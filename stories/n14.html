<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>
<!--
<h5>(Page 14 of 16)</h5>
<p>
Muran of the Lngwesi did not approach Nalantei in the early weeks. 
But other muran, ambitious in travel, late in their time of freedom,
would enter the rebuilt nkang, questioning, waiting.  Will there be a
dance?  The elders could not sleep well, and the girls, laughing from
their huts, sought the dark eyes of the muran, each one, girl and
muran, eager in ambition and hope.</p>
<p>
Nalantei's demure removal, her counsel among the women, did not
exclude her from their notice.  One muran, tall, gaunt and refined in
feature, his hair cut short in anticipation of elderhood, stood for
long minutes in silence as Nalantei devoted herself to the coarse
fabric of her new hut.  He addressed her formally but with a smile
she did not acknowledge.  She did not answer him.  He spoke again,</p>
<p>
"Who is your husband, young wife?" 
</p>
<p>
"You can see, can you not, that I am at labor for my man? 
Please permit me to continue my work."  She did not greet him
further, but perceived his retreat only as the sound of sandaled
footsteps on the dry earth.</p>
<p>
Nor did she sing.  As she tore new pale green strands of palm, the
story was the palm alone, of its circuitous meandering through dried
sticks, bent and bound, palm that tickled her fingers and rustled
softly in the calm of the high-risen sun.  She ran her fingers along
every strand, her forehead lowered, bowed against the glare, as she
wove a new circle within her sphere.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
"May I see her now?  Is she alone?  The sun is high and we might
run to the shore. There is no one, she is alone."  Nalantei
heard no answer from Naperu, only the sudden running steps of
Maluni's approach.  "Come, we must go together," said
Maluni, approaching the unfinished hut.</p>
<p>
They walked almost every day in the late afternoon, Nalantei quiet
and graceful, Maluni scampering up hills, running off toward a
luckless bird or new flower, returning to Nalantei with the careless
energy of a calf, but inexplicably, singing new songs of astonishing
lewdness which she and other girls were developing and practicing
with the muran.  These were images and words that Nalantei did not
understand, had never heard, which Maluni would not explain, laughing
uncontrollably as Nalantei voiced them questioningly.</p>
<p>
"The muran of the Lngwesi from far away come to visit us now,"
Maluni said.  "Do you know that there is a special one who
watches you?"  Nalantei did not answer.  "You must greet
them; they see you are graceful and your manner does not beg for
praise but only admiration.  They see what you are."</p>
<p>
"The muran are all impetuous and lack respect," said
Nalantei.  "They are like buck who prance and posture; they have
the arrogant fleeting color of foolish birds.  They are as unruly and
wrathful as hungry dogs.  I see them sometimes."  But she
thought of one who had stood by her as she worked . . . yes, his face
was kind.  Maluni frowned and laughed again, guarding her secrets.</p>
<p>
"My father, your husband, used to tell me of his warrior days,"
said Maluni.  "But now he does not trust the muran.  I think he
is afraid for me, but not only for me."  Nalantei was confused
and even annoyed, though she could not say why.</p>
<p>
"But the man, my husband, should fear nothing, as he is well
respected among the elders and the muran."  Maluni faced
Nalantei with the dark focus she seemed to recognize, the unrelenting
inquisition of a worldly child that was familiar, though she could
not say how.</p>
<p>
"The
elders are the ones who have the most to fear, as they grow weak and
foolish and must protect themselves and their honor.  It is <I>their</I>
Nkanyit."  Nalantei gasped at these words and could not speak
before Maluni asked, "Will you love him, my father, as my mother
has before you?"</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 A muran stood before her as she crouched alone within the spine and
ribs of her new hut. His hair was short and without ocher, though he
retained some finish of his station: spears, the long knife and
rungu, and some ornament of beads.  His ivory ear plugs had been
replaced by a fine cut bundle of dry grass stems.  His was the same
kind face she had observed but avoided when he approached her two
days earlier, with a smile which showed in its lines his progress to
elderhood.  Nalantei thought of a worn butterfly, as the young man
was loath to release himself from the freedom of the muran, yet he
must advance with his age-set and laughingly greet the eventual grey
indignity of elderhood, for which his new grown authority would be
little compensation.</p>
<p>
He stood before her and begged her eyes to rest upon him, but in her
nod of acknowledgment he received less measure than a bow gives to a
kiss.  He stood for some minutes watching as she worked, as her
fingers folded the palm and oldupai like a dance alone in
unrestrained gestures; she caressed the fibers, pressing them in her
hands, weaving in a circle, standing back to assess the pattern,
kneeling to form an even line, parallel to the smooth lake shining
far below, as if the whole circle (though founded in a trench dug in
the earth) was hanging, suspended. From the dark-soiled volcanic
slope she faced westward and down, so that from her kneeling position
the hut appeared to have no mooring, but to hover above the land, to
float above the Jade Sea in a whisper.  She thought she could see the
Lmolo settlement to the south, below on the horizon, land bound, sea
salted, in desolate isolation and vulnerability.  "They should
float as I do," she thought.  She could see the points in motion
that might be children, those who had run to her side, grasping her
hands with ebullient smiles, in anticipation of gifts to come: sweet
apples that flew from her hands as if the smiles of children made
magic, and she, now a wife, might make magic too . . . as she flew
above, no longer suspended, yet in captivity to whispers in laughter.</p>
<p>
He leaned to share her idyll with an ambivalence of emotion to which
he would not yet give the word, despair.</p>
