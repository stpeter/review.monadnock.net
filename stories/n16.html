<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>

<h5>(Page 16 of 16)</h5>
<p>
There were few clouds as early evening light clarified the scene
before her.  Alone again among the reticulate shadows of her
unfinished home and the budding scarlet of her new fire &#151; much
like that fading image on the shore beyond the western hills &#151; Nalantei
heard the voices, sometimes singly, often cascading, dust blanketing
dust, distant like the resonance of a drum beat long after the
strike, but persisting: the aged woman who was her mother, called her
daughter once again; the man who had lifted her chin to catch her
eye, smiled, a comfort even as he slept noisily near her in years
past, though become old to lean upon a stick; the teacher who was
tender but had lost Nkanyit and dressed in the cloth of the town; the
other women who shared with her their laughter and their bitterness,
turned to her, their bodies diminished, hollowed; running children
approached to look into her eyes, children who would become women,
and children that would be men; and the muran, ever youthful, proud,
and in a dance of voices, called her distantly with their special
words, secret from the elders &#151; young men . . . and there had been
a boy in black skins, all but naked yet a boy, proud almost, resolute
and stern almost, who became a warrior only for herself, who limped
as he walked, a muran, yet possessing neither the grace nor strength
of her father, that among slight men was slighter still, who was
driven out into the world of men like a male cub, he not fully maned
or tough clawed, but scarred at birth, yet eager in his inevitable
progress, who stood shining like the blade of a spear for her, and
for whom she was not a child, and took her body for his pleasure as
she took his.  
</p>
<p>
Forgetting was her art: remembering to forget the odor of sacrifice,
to forget the night wind's rage, forgetting even in sleep her
warrior's distant weakening steps, forgetting his laughter,
which had become only the distant whisper of a child.</p>
<p>
Maluni approached slowly, seeing that Nalantei sat in a revery which
appeared to be a more profound occupation than any handiwork.  "Good
evening, mother," she said, respectfully.  "The women have
asked me to call you.  They are sitting together and wish for you to
join them."  It was clear from the formality of her tone that
Maluni was not also welcome among the women at this time.  She was
not, however, seriously diminished in spirit, sitting quickly within
the skeleton of the hut.</p>
<p>
"My brother could not stop looking at you," she said.</p>
<p>
"Surely he wishes to be friendly," Nalantei answered
pointedly.  "Perhaps he also resents the loss of those cattle
which are now my allotted herd."  Maluni frowned. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The women were watching.  Alone among them, Nalantei, the girl who
was a woman, the woman who was a wife, listened to their words as a
child listens, for whom every word and sentiment is a growing world. 
She would live among them.  This was her home and her life; there
could be no other.</p>
<p>
"How old the elders will look as they lose hope in a new young
wife," one of the women said.</p>
<p>
"It must be within two years," said Naperu, "no matter
their stubbornness.  The &#145;Ilmugit Lelaingoni' will begin
with the Lmasula clan, who are rich with muran who would marry.  Our
elders must follow their lead and welcome the older muran to their
company."  The women sat in a semicircle facing each other, two
were weaving baskets, and one, with little enthusiasm, was pounding
millet.  Nting'idua nursed her child.  Their purpose was
laughter.</p>
<p>
"Friend," said another woman (addressing Nalantei), "will
you sing with us this evening?  Your husband has not yet learned to
fear you.  We will sing of the elders and praise them as when they
were muran.  They will shiver in their inadequacy, as they have no
stomach these days to compete with us in words."  Their laughter
grew as Nalantei answered, 
</p>
<p>
"I will sing with you.  I will make verses to laugh with you to
shame them as they attempt to ignore us.  I will carry a switch with
me and join you to winnow out the weak ones, and waylay them.  I will
slaughter a goat so we may take it into the bush like boys in black
and it will be our feast.  Let any one among them try to whip me and
they will learn of my spirit."  Their laughing continued and
they clenched their hands rhythmically as if their shaking voices
were a blessing.  Nting'idua laughed so intensely that her child
released her oral clutch, but did not cry immediately, overwhelmed by
the resonance of laughter, so superior in tone and dominant in affect
to a crying squeal. 
</p>
<p>
"Will
<I>he</I> come to you soon?" asked
Nting'idua, hoping not to catch Naperu's eye. 
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps soon," said Nalantei softly, "I do not wish
to think of it.  I will build my hut slowly, and so tight that no
arrow will pierce it, no morning dew will invade."</p>
<p>
Darkness was approaching, and a delicate breeze brushed her shawl and
cheek.  She smiled at the gesture, so like the imposing deliberate
motion of a young cheetah exploring the bush, having the nature of
the winds of Kulal, but naive in intensity.  As the cool evening
spread around them, Nalantei spoke of the night's calm and the
Loiyangalani bush so far away, and of this day, where just here, in
her new small world, she would begin her sixteenth year of life.</p>
<p>
 Nalantei lay awake in her own newly finished hut, rapt and
disquieted by the silence: the windless calm which might be more
portent than peace, like the shallow before a wave, the breath before
a scream, the inhalation from Kulal before the next palm bending rush
. . . which never came, like time stopped, as indecent as a failing
heart or any death stillness, knowing that these cold stars &#151; the
stars of Ngai which she recognized as the same stars of her
childhood &#151; held her but did not know her, even under the ever
blinking cycle of the moon.  
</p>
<p>
 Resting alone in that quiet night, she imagined another night soon
to come when her man would stoop low to enter. . .  "You may see
the home I have built for us, husband," she would say.  And upon
the matted earth beside the cool goat skin he would lay his sandals
and his walking stick, as he must labor to know her, with no magic or
curse &#151; as she must lead him in her way, his proffered tenderness
held apart from her true embrace by the intricately woven sphere of
her impenetrable soul.
