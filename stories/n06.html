<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 6 of 16)</h5>
<p>
 Lekapana faces Teresa, whose lowered eyes shift suddenly to him,
both bidden and reserved.  His manner requires no words, she must
leave, and will not be welcome again until dawn.  Teresa steps out,
unable to form a smile or greeting for Sienti.  Of the women, only
Sienti may remain, within her own hut with the daughter she has so
recently and easily lost.  And as she is surrounded by the masters of
Nkanyit in her own place of pride, she does not yet feel her loss. 
The evening deepens.  Nalantei sits, propped on a samburr bag,
surrounded by several elders, before the smoke and glowing embers of
the fire. 
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, our daughter, do you hear the songs of the muran as
they dance today?"  Lekapana's voice is direct and
insistent, with little warmth.  "We can laugh at them together,
yes?  Do they care about you?  No, you are lost to them and they have
forgotten.  They will sing only to the younger girls, the Nkoliontoi.
 They are impetuous and lack respect.  They prance and preen with the
impermanent fleeting colors of foolish birds.  May we not laugh at
their arrogance, at their posturing?  Oh yes, they are beautiful, the
muran.  But a boy behind the ocher, this mask over truth, is a child
who, like yourself, knows little of the world, but in plumed youth
would be a hero and leap for you, raid cattle, even blood his spear,
and quiver in the madness of his insubstantial blood.  Those were
good games, were they not, Nalantei?  The muran are like buck who
strut and posture, pronking high on their legs while the wise leopard
watches, and waits.  But what can a muran give you? . . . buttons and
beads, and his boyhood love which fades like a flower's plumage.
 Who stays by you now?  Answer me."</p>
<p>
"Sir?"</p>
<p>
"Who will give you what you need?"  Silence.  "It is
your husband, the man, Sopoitan. . .  Who is it?"  Silence. 
"Say his name."</p>
<p>
"Is it permitted?"</p>
<p>
"I have told you so. . .  Who is it?"</p>
<p>
"He is Sopoitan."</p>
<p>
"And what is Sopoitan?"</p>
<p>
"An elder."</p>
<p>
"What is he to you?"</p>
<p>
"I am given to him."</p>
<p>
"Will you love and respect this elder, your husband."</p>
<p>
"I do respect, sir.  I do."  Nalantei is transfixed,
absorbed in the newly rising flame of the fire, as Sienti spits into
its glowing core, and the elder, Sopoitan, leans forward to nudge the
embers and add his own dry sticks to feed that which lives in
consuming.</p>
<p>
Nearby, Kioban's voice rises, as she passes by with her mother,</p>
<p>
"May she not dance with the muran?  May she dance?" 
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps she will watch the dance," says Partuala.  
</p>
<p>
"The muran are looking our way," says Kioban, now more
sullen.  "Mother, must we wait until dark?  The dance may end
soon.  They called for her." 
</p>
<p>
"You may go join the other girls.  Our place is not here."</p>
<p>
"Is she so sick?  Is she sick?  They were calling to her and we
will miss the dance."</p>
<p>
"What, did you hear her name spoken, daughter?"</p>
<p>
"No, not her name," Kioban says, smiling.</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
 Nalantei had risen from her altar the previous night, before
sunrise, but the eyes she had sought were another's:  In
darkness, in half sleep, she rose to the entrance of her mother's
hut, an opening to the stars, unsettled further by the rare distant
feeding screech of a hyena, and sensed the presence of a man, then
heard footsteps and the droplet patter of urine, and waiting, heard
the stomping of a donkey and the cool night's burn of her fear
came back to her &#151; it was her marriage day.  She crouched to step
beyond her thatched retreat and stood before Kulal to sense the last
rushing of night, the winds early retreat.  The broad mountain was
dark against the stars and waxing moon, though soon to be a more
profound  silhouette in the eastern sky.  He was as quiet as the
night breeze as he looked at her, and though she could barely see his
eyes, she knew Francis, as he leaned in his own way against two bare
spears, his face shining of red ocher, dressed in warrior's
cloth as she had never before seen him.  A stirring from inside the
hut did not distract Nalantei &#151; her mother, Sienti, would not rise
now &#151; nor did the approach of Francis's fellow muran, Kimiti,
whose polite marking at a distance was complete.  It seemed as they
faced each other that there need not be words.   She too appeared
strange in her new colors which blessed the pangs of separation that
they already sensed &#151; her head shaven and smoothed by Sienti, the
band of fine beads on her forehead, all shining deep red in the
moonlight.  Perhaps it was the animals' restlessness, or the
imminent daybreak which would bring with it the full weight of
Nkanyit &#151; of no meaning between them but force &#151; but she knew
there would be no futile stand in resistance, as courage and honor
are prerequisite but secondary in a solitude of stars.  Perhaps it
was their equal perceptions, already conjoined in a progress to
estrangement; perhaps this and more was summed in the slight shaking
of her head to which he acquiesced, yet Nalantei knew that these, her
night guardians, must leave her before the first light or follow the
custom and ceremony of relinquishment.  
</p>
<p>
A cow, Sienti's own, shuffled nearby and was ready, but it was
too early for milk, or blood, under the moon. 
</p>
<p>
As
she lay in longer minutes, returned to her mother's hut and the
darkness, she sensed his body, his presence:  Francis, standing near
. . . who had been a boy in black skins, all but naked yet a boy,
become a warrior, proud resolute stern serene secret, dark and
secret, who took her life and contained it, as in a small leather
vessel, an nkarau, precious to him like the last blood; and she was
lanced for it, that blood, so he might drink at his will and take the
more from her body as from the slaughtered cow, his lips moist in the
pleasure of her life, but that she not conceive, withdraw the blooded
lance, her body so consumed and yet taken again that would not bleed;
and she too might hold him for herself, take him freely and draw life
from him &#151; like lions spent, until they may only sleep &#151; but
keep him too, contained in an nkarau of ecstatic life, not passed or
shared but guarded as hers alone. . .  It could be hidden, held
precious like a child, but from <I>his</I>
body, taken whole and warm, soft, and carried with her, still vital
like the boy, livened to a touch, carried for herself, alone.  
</p>
<p>
But the winds were weak, and in her heated vision she lay, knowing
that Francis would not abandon his guard until morning, would not
enter the hut or speak; but the ochered head and sinewy body of a
warrior grew for herself alone, from bleeding grasses with no second,
a human form, moist in fervor, the taut intensity and intention
unified to which her naked hand was drawn and from whose reassurance
her tears ran in pleasure and in loss, and the raw founded belief
that this joy was hers alone, that she had always known it.  But he
would be torn from her.</p>
