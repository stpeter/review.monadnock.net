<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>

<h5>(Page 4 of 16)</h5>
<p>"Nalantei. Nalantei, you may not rest now.  Hear me, Nalantei!"</p>
<p><em>Whose voice is that I hear, is someone calling?</em></p>
<p>Sienti remains within her own hut with the daughter she has so recently and easily lost.  In the fire illuminated darkness she is surrounded by the masters of Nkanyit in her own place of pride and does not yet feel her loss.  Teresa has moved over to sit by Nalantei.  It is the last gesture she will be permitted.  The elders will not wait as the shroud-quiet of evening is short.  Lekapana the inquisitor directs himself to Nalantei once again:</p>
<p>"Would we give you to Sopoitan if we did not love you?" Silence.  "Nalantei, do you know what day this is?  Look at me, Nalantei.  Why do we do this?  Do you know that it is because we love you?  We give you to this man who is worthy and good, and who claims you in pride.  There are men of such passions that would beat you for no reason.  You will not give Sopoitan reason to beat you, not for that arrogant smile we have seen?  Do you listen?  Open your eyes, as this will be the night before your day.  I believe you do not smile this evening because this worthy man has killed the marriage ox to become your husband, and you sense that you are fully Samburu, a woman and pure.  Is this so?  You will not abandon your calling?  You will honor this man?"  She does not answer.  "Would you bring a curse on your family?"</p>
<p>"Nalantei, there is also the curse which a husband may cause upon his wife.  In this curse a wife may lose a child or she may die for the dishonor she has brought."  Nalantei sits upright and in a new animation, stares at Lekapana:</p>
<p>"Never, never was there such a curse in my home.  My father would not.  He has never!"</p>
<p>"No, Nalantei," Lekapana answers awkwardly, "not Perean, who is a worthy man."</p>
<p>"Never," she says again, softly.</p>
<p>"Nalantei, your mother, Sienti, came to us seventeen years ago and has not run from her husband; she gave you life and has become old.  Her example is the one you must follow.  If you live as she has you will never earn the curse of Sopoitan or see him raise his hand in anger.  Will you love him as we love you?"  Silence.  "Now that you are pure in Ngai you are a woman.  Nalantei, do you know that we give you to him because we love you?"  No answer.</p>
<p>"And can you find a better second man that Lekiso?  Nalantei, did you hear their love?"</p>
<p>"I heard the voices of these elders I do not know, and who do not know me."</p>
<p>"Nalantei, have you heard the voices of women sing with this love?"</p>
<p>"No, the women do not sing of love."</p>
<p>But the women did sing, that morning, after the night winds' retreat, after her warrior's shivering collapse only hours earlier in the moonlit night, after her purification, after the knife:  There were twelve who gathered by the hut.  Nalantei gasped for breath and sat forward as the voices of women surrounded her, converging beyond the incomplete barrier, the insulation of a thatch of yellow palm and oldupai.  Sienti stood facing Kulal, which seemed a dark halo before the emerging sun, her own new goat skin cloak with a ridge of goat hair and cowrie shells glistened down her back in the early light. Sienti led them in their women's song, the rich focused rasp that is their freedom, where alone they may find a special courage and power to assert their deepest scorn, and in doing so draw each other into shared afflictions and to laughter, in their lullaby of torment:</p>
<p>"New sister, now so surely among us and of the land and pure, you will see what the men will have you be.  You will be taken from us before the second sun and, hateful one, you will forget us as the men will bring you to your new home and teach you with the stick that you will learn respect.  Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>Forget your father, as he is old and lecherous and afraid of your sight.  Forget his old skin and his shrunken hands.  Forget your father because he is no longer your protector and is lost to you.  You will soon be gone from us.  May Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>Forget the elders of your clan, the Lmasula elders that you learned to fear.  Their bodies are old and they hang like the ears of a goat.  They are nothing to you now, nothing as they have always been, but of your girlish past.  Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>But your new man is small and weak and his cattle may die, and if he cares for you, you are lucky.  But because he is weak, his beating will not break you.  And his stink will be the one you know when he comes to you, unless the other man comes, his second, whose odor is worse.  Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>The Lngwesi clan elders will enter your house in lust, and when you learn that they droop and sag, that their clouded eyes are stiffer than their man's parts, you will laugh and laugh; and when they beckon, you will turn from them and they will wonder, alone and pitifully, if they were ever fathers to a child.  May Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>Forget your lover's eager poking stick and his odor.  That is all from your girlish days.  Forget his promises which are forever broken, and forever in the past.  But you may have secrets which will be yours alone, special secrets to keep you, as you will soon be taken from us and forget.  May Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>You were once a girl who in foolishness and lust slept with young men, forgetting your mother's lessons and the dark eyes of the elders.  You must awaken from your dream that in your second age you will be a mother to Lngwesi muran, and be a mother to a mother in your time.  Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>But you will have your secrets and your cattle.  If you are blessed you will have beautiful black cattle among the Lngwesi, and their milk and your milk will raise your children.  Then, as your men wither and weaken, your sons will be warriors and will abhor your milk and your care.  Yes, Ngai will bless you.</p>
<p>Your sons will take the cattle and leave you, and when they marry you will throw their long braided hair upon the water to pass from your life.  And your daughters you will hardly know, as they will love the muran but be torn from you as they bleed, as you bleed.  Ngai bless you.</p>
<p>New sister, now fully of the land and pure, you will see what the men will have you be.  You will be taken from us before the second sun and, hateful one, you will forget.  You must forget.  But may Ngai bless you in your new life.  May Ngai bless you . . . and keep your secrets."</p>
<p>"We must prepare," Sienti said, and motioned Nalantei to
reenter the hut.</p>
<p>Alone in near darkness, Nalantei sensed the haughty voices of the women as an incomprehensible wash of bird calls and breeze among the nearby palms.  She lay upon her left side facing the rear of the hut, her right arm over an eye and ear to extinguish sensation, and yet it was her mother's voice, rising again in command, her authority ringing, cajoling in ceremonial assertiveness among the women, that she could not silence, and which sustained her waking.</p>
<p>"Friend, I have asked my husband for you and he has spoken also to his second, the elder, Lekapana.  They do not care.  Kioban may stay now but must be quiet and remain at a distance until the ox is killed.  At this hour the men are not concerned with us, but the lash of reeds is harsh should we profane <I>their</I> rites."</p>
<p>"I can stay, mother?" asked Kioban.</p>
<p>"Yes, until the evening and the dance."</p>
<p>"Will I stir the ox blood?"</p>
<p>"If the elders allow it."</p>
<p>"Is she alone now?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes daughter.  You know she is in her mother's hut."</p>
<p>"Nalantei was good to me."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"But she walks tomorrow.  Is it far?"</p>
<p>"No, not so far, you will see her again, one day."</p>
<p>"Is she afraid?  Why is she so quiet?  She is so quiet." Partuala turned from her daughter and saw Teresa also watching the entrance to the hut as the women spread a wide cow skin first and then a sheep skin over it.</p>
<p>"Ask the &#145;mother-teacher' how it is," Partuala said to Kioban, the mild rancor not disguised.  Teresa, youngest of the women present, and therefore the newest among them, understood that this was her own test, to lift her own suppressed memories to words.</p>
<p>"How is it, teacher? asked Kioban.  Why must a girl change?  Must I lose everyone as she will?</p>
<p>"I must remember," said Teresa. "I will try to remember, but you may not understand."  Kioban was resentful but silent.  Teresa began:  "I know that I was afraid because I did not know.  I remember . . . but it is impossible for a girl to know.  There is some pain, but my father. . ."  Her voice halted suddenly.  Kioban leaned down impatiently to see into the hut where Nalantei lay on her couch.</p>
<p>"Remember the sick sheep?  We bound it away and it lay as she does, removed from its mother, breathing like that because it could not rise, could not see, lying on its side like death."</p>
<p>"Kioban, you must be silent or I will send you to your hut alone, and no crying will make any difference."</p>
<p>"I would not cry, why should I?"</p>
<p>"We have asked the teacher to speak.  Listen to her." Teresa again strove to bring the disjunct, broken traces to a consciousness that was altered to her new life and to the vocation of teacher that was in itself an alienation.  The words choked her.  And there were Kioban's insolent dark eyes.</p>
<p>"I remember my home village to the south, beyond lake Logipi in the Ndoto mountains where it is greener than my home . . . I mean, than here. The cattle are white and I said to my . . . that I would walk here.  I remember I was afraid, but they loved me &#151; I see it now, but it is impossible for a girl to know.  You cannot know.  The pain is short and in the dancing and the song, in the nightfall voices of the men, I came to know Nkanyit.  I was more afraid because they said that even on that day an elder might claim me when I was Ngaibartani, take me in the quiet of the night though I might never see him; he would kill his ox where I slept and take me.  I was afraid.  It is so soon for a girl. . .  They said that my beauty was the wide mouth of a weaver bird chick that begs in indiscriminate hunger but must grow to know another in another land.  I remember, but it was my childhood home, not this one.  I remember that I told them I wanted to have children, and I . . . they said I would, but I must be a teacher first as I asked, and as my . . . father granted &#151; but not leave them as Nkoliontoi, not as a girl and impure.  I remember that I walked with the women to this place, my home, but I had no husband, only the school, and the &#145;Jesus' who was new, and what I learned. . .  But it is short, the pain &#151; the body heals.  I remember that I was afraid, as Nalantei is afraid, but my . . . he stood at a distance, as you, Kioban, must do, and I saw that it must be so, as they said, and that they loved me as they said, but I had no husband to follow to this place, my home, but I remember . . . that forgetting comes easier then; you forget a little pain, or causes, or too many murmurings inside, you have to, and then you do not feel it, but there was the mission and the school and I was a teacher &#151; and Father, the priest, praised me.  But I was Ngaibartani and he came for me, the man, but not in the night, no, he watched me and learned that I was not of the Lmasula clan, but you know that my . . . father could not travel, but it was done.  They said I was beautiful and pure, and I was a teacher to the children, all of them we see, and now I am a wife . . . oh, I have not seen them for years, and my father. . .  The elders spoke long into the night, but this is my home so I did not walk, only some few steps, but before I came to this place I was afraid because I did not know, a girl cannot know.  The pain passes quickly and you forget, and then you do not feel.  They held me as I held Nalantei, and I knew they loved me."</p>
<p>Kioban moved closer to Teresa.  "Do they love her?" she asked.  "Does Ngai love her?"  Partuala grabbed her daughter's arm and pulled her abruptly.</p>
<p>"What have I told you?  You must learn with your eyes and ears, not only your mouth. These are special hours.  Stand over there by the acacia, do you want me to send you away?"</p>
<p>"I will go away.  I will go where my father sends me in my time.  Why should I not?"</p>
<p>No greeting had passed between Nalantei and Kioban, nor indeed had Nalantei intoned a word to the women since the Ltorobo woman washed her blade, as though the incision had also severed voice and song and left a deeper wound: The women stood in justification of the rite, and Nalantei could only wait for the elders &#151; who in their time would come to feast and give their blessing.  But still, the murmurings in her quiet sleep were as joyous in magnitude as the weight of her ineffable present was ponderous.</p>
<p>The silence had in these hours matured into a myth, unchallenged and sovereign, as a voiceless being is no one but a story, and a question; so Kioban, as she brushed by in her egress, might in her questioning, in her slight and child-formed conceptions, see Nalantei as a body without a soul, and later that evening, with her mother, Partuala, relinquish her friend without a farewell or a wish.</p>
<p>The women's voices subsided, but the elder, the man, Perean, did not appear to sweep their voices free. Might she call to him like a boy, to demand the gift of a cow, which like herself is the sacred supplier of milk to a new home and a new man?  And she too &#151; pierced for it some months before &#151; is the supplier of blood, though this womanly blood is for the moon alone.</p>
<p>She is ashamed of her bleeding, and of her blood.  Is there a special purity in blood from the knife, or a profanity in commingling?  She bleeds doubly on this day, and wonders in fear if there is dishonor in it.  The women know, and as she lies again as at the hour of her cleansing, it is the women's voices which return as a bruising deepens in shame.</p>
<p>Nalantei cannot move in her dreaming.  She awakens slowly to the settling of harsh voices, a silence like nakedness among the women, the moment of shame like a witness to death, as shadows observe, she among lesser shadows that command a helpless body: the object and witness to corruption.  "Why do they sing?  I do not understand them.  It is not a song.  The women must never sing."</p>
<p>"Nalantei.  The women do not sing."</p>
