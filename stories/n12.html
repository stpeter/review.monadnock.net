<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 12 of 16)</h5>
<p>
She had never known such rain.  Only a few days after the marriage
dance, as they settled at the temporary nkang at the foot of Kulal,
it began.  The thunder made the earth and the huts shake with more
anger and severity than any wind.  Three women waited, alone in a
hut, expecting the sweet air of a long awaited shower, and when the
first storm came, more an assault than a gift, Nalantei, Naperu and
Sopoitan's aged mother sat together waiting for it to pass. 
With rain came the hope that these few families could return to their
preferred homeland to the northwest and establish a settlement nearer
to the lake.  As a child, Nalantei had stood beneath the darkened sky
preceding the rain, which in an afternoon mocked the evening change
though without the horizon's color, but did not summon her,
could not entice her to return, running to her mother's hut,
panting joyously, eager for her evening milk.  That sky made the
donkeys stomp nervously, the palm trees shed their dust.  The rain,
spitting its blessing, direct and cool &#151; which made them bow, the
donkey heads, the hair-wet palms &#151; all voices were glad for it,
that the grass might grow for a few weeks, the animals gain strength,
each Samburu with hope restored that there could be rain, that
drought was not eternal.  
</p>
<p>
But this rain brought death.  The earth, the cotton soil, could not
quaff so deeply or so long.  The luggas and sand rivers became raging
torrents, filling and collapsing water holes that had not been
engulfed in years.</p>
<p>
It fell to Nalantei to rebuild the hut she shared those first days
with the old woman, Sopoitan's mother, who suffered deeply from
the rain.  On the second day it came again, as if the lake itself had
been thrown aloft; the air was thick with moisture, and the night was
cold. The huts, ill prepared for so unrelenting a deluge, were
weakening.  Some on lower ground were inundated and abandoned.  The
woven palm, fibers heavy with water that had soaked through skins and
mud, began to collapse, and the sleeping mats were damp, drawing away
a body's heat.  On the fourth day the night's chill stayed
with the old woman who lay silently, unable to move, her eyelids
drooping, hanging like the palm leaves.  Others came to keep watch
and lend comfort with Nalantei, but the wraps around the frail body
seemed to hold no warmth.  They spoke her name as they rubbed her
arms, again and again they spoke it, that perhaps she might hear, and
the diminishing sphere of her world might not collapse so soon.  At
first she shivered, but all motion gradually ceased as the rain had
won, drawing life away as her eyes alone, rolling deeply in her head,
searched for her son.  No one was certain when she died, as her
ancient calm required so little breath.  Her body, of little
substance, was carried to a nearby outcropping of rock, and that was
all.  Sopoitan did not join the women walking to that place.  He sat
silently and alone in Naperu's hut.  The old woman who had been
his mother was gone.  Her life and his duty to her were done.</p>
<p>
The rains came again in a few days, as if in a calculation that any
seed upon a new land &#151; grasping in the quickly drying mud of the
newly cut bank, in its impulse to grow, to reach a bloom, but before
its roots sank deeply &#151; might be washed in a new flow, an
intemperate whim in furtive darkness, a test in cold uncommon mists,
with sounds even a cat might not accept.  As the wind swirled the
rain in circles that seemed to rise about the small nkang of huts
causing them to shudder as if to be unmoored, siphoned upward, there
was from one angle, one point in indefinite space, the plaint of an
infant, whose punctuated wailing desperation pierced the blackness of
the starless night as if arisen from damp inebriate foliage and mud,
and, in the intervening silence, part of the same cluster of
perceptions, at one with the wind, rose the cackling laughter of a
young woman, the incongruous coalescence of mirth and misery blending
in an unnatural cacophony, yet bound in space, while the sky might
wish to absorb it all, where beyond them, out further to the north
and west, the call was general to a huddled silence in reverence: the
delicate gazelles' backs arched, their tails silent to shed the
moisture, waiting, merely waiting in cool discomfort and never absent
wariness, the leopard draped upon a limb by a swelling lugga, in his
curious attendance, watching as the water intensified its scavenging
. . . as again the laughter rose with the rain amid the eerie broken
cries of the child.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Often Maluni came to sit with Nalantei, who to the younger girl
seemed so wise, having come from the larger community of 
Loiyangalani where Samburu and Turkana live together.  Maluni could
not imagine a school where so many of her own age would sit together.
 "How can you know them?  How can there be so many whose lives
are untold to you but who live all around you?  I have heard that the
Turkana are giants.  How can they live with so few cattle?  Were you
like me once, long ago?"   They laughed together, standing near
the shore at dusk, where only weeks before, waiting at this hour,
Nalantei might have been alone, attending the first sign of the
insolent winds below Kulal. The young girl's voice was softer,
less demanding than another young voice Nalantei had known, the lost
friend who might be waiting by the lake far away, confident only that
the winds would come. 
</p>
<p>
Nalantei studied Maluni as a mother might observe her growing child,
in wonder at what so few years had created, so far from what mere
molding might produce; this child, distant and yet absorbing and
vulnerable, was in her self protection cruel in the way that a child
may not merely learn, but must diligently and aggressively develop.  
</p>
<p>
"I was fearless and foolish as a child," Nalantei said. 
"In such a large town as Loiyangalani where men are so deprived
of adventure and so limited in action, having no herds to tend, they
create occasion for conflict.  Instead of spears, some carry rifles,
which can stop a man at a great distance.  Most of our men do not
hunt for food, yet for some, Nkanyit is so disregarded that with no
shame they gather and eat fish like the Lmolo."  Maluni frowned
in disgust as Nalantei continued.  "I did not see the danger
living among the Turkana, who have not lost the spirit of their
fathers.  They are large and powerful and their women can carry a
huge weight on their heads.  But they are men and women such as we,
and grow to an age.  In Loiyangalani we depended on some in our
families who live in a settlement near here where there is grass,
those who tended our cattle."</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Maluni, smiling.  "I have seen them
sometimes at the watering holes while we waited our turn with cattle
and goats."  Nalantei did not return her smile or acknowledge
the memory, as if memories were only dreams, private and personal.</p>
<p>
"In Loiyangalani some have learned the words of the travelers
and the government.  Some work for their families while others stand
by and are hungry.  They do not have Nkanyit and are not like us."</p>
<p>
"Then they will die," said Maluni.  Nalantei searched for
memories that were incomplete, with words that changed and were
broken in the gaze of a young muran who had turned from her and
walked . . .  
</p>
<p>
"Someone once told me that I am free.  Here among the Lngwesi I
do not think of that.  I have learned how to listen and to attend,
like the cat.  I learned it in a dream."  
</p>
<p>
"I do not have dreams often," said Maluni.  "Not that
I remember.  I like the daylight time when my choices are clear.  But
what was your dream?"</p>
<p>
"I
always dream of people and of places that I know," Nalantei
said.  "But I am no longer part of those people, and they have
changed, or I have.  It is in my dreams that I remember.  Once, when
I was a girl, I knew a small cat which was kept by a Laibon, a
strange white man who gave it milk and meat.  In my dream  I was
delicate and secret and walked like the cat, alone and quiet among
men and women who did not see me and did not care.  I turned to their
words and understood anger and fear, and I knew some kindness.  I had
almost forgotten, and did not know.  It is impossible for a girl to
know.  Soon I <I>became</I> the small cat
among strange voices, who, in the livening of evening's rise to
its desires &#151; to chirping flight, in searching for motion with a
racing heart &#151; saw all that there must be, and as cat, all that
there could be; so beneath the tall forms who are all mothers in
comfort and sustenance (though often rejecting in a kick or by a hand
that lifts) I sensed it all newly:  the dust that blows, the dim
hunting light, the territory to be watched, the scent of another, the
fight and mating call, the breath and whispers, the odors of meat, of
milk and of men, the lake-salted fish, the dangerous feet of
children, pain in hunger, in silence, in age, in frailty; I knew
peace in voices rising in smoke saturated huts in the spreading dawn
light that warms the earth for our sleep. You forget a little pain. 
The voices told me that this is what is, what must be, all accepted,
unquestioned.  As a cat I lay by the fire, its glowing embers large
but inviting, and I saw them all, voices in eyes beyond the embers,
and it was to me that they spoke without words &#151; their hands
grasping in a blessing as they taunted me &#151; of life threatening
peril, of dark eyes lurking and the threat of the curse.  You forget
a little pain, or causes, or too many murmurings inside and then you
do not feel.  I could not understand, it is impossible. . .  But it
was for love that the fire burned, I knew, and I understood that my
place was to walk with them, and lie with them by the fire.  &#145;This
is the world,' say the obscure unknowable voices, say the birds,
says the wind.  Of course, there can be no other."  Nalantei
waited for Maluni to speak, but when she did not, said:  "This
was my dream, that a cat may walk among men, and in accepting the
world, and the whispering within, never imagine how it would feel to
die."    
</p>
<p>
"I listen too," Maluni said, "and I will walk like the
cat one day, as you have learned to do."          Several women
were gathering nearby for their accustomed afternoon meeting. 
Maluni, only recently permitted to join them was about to leave as
Nalantei asked,</p>
<p>
"I heard crying last night.  It was like a child, but I could
not be sure, with the rain and thunder and the other strange . . ."</p>
<p>
"Oh yes," Maluni answered quickly.  "Nting'idua
has a new child.  She stayed away for the first few days, soon after
the birth, even during the rains, protected by the cliffs and rocks. 
She is back with us now.  It is only a girl child, but she also has
two boys through Ngai's blessing, four children altogether.  She
is a curious but happy mother, that one."</p>
