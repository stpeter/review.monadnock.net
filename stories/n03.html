<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 3 of 16)</h5>
<p>
In Loiyangalani the morning light crawls.  The stars recede, but
above Kulal there is no nascent burst of light, as the sky is clear
and full long before the fire white eye opens, belated and hot, to an
already driven land.</p>
<p>
Earlier that morning, before sunrise, Nalantei could only wait,
unable to rest, the dilute milk of her cleansing nearly dry against
her shining skin, facing Kulal and the summit abode of Ngai, god of
many mountains.   The rituals of the morning complete, she lay in
reluctance to motion as new voices came too soon, and she heard the
high-pitched song of young Kioban, a contradiction to her own spirit.
 Kioban chirped like a dawn-bird following her mother, Partuala, who,
in her second age, motherhood, in her life's anger of
forgetting, unafraid of change &#151; both daughter and mother
unafraid, as ignorance and indifference are well partnered &#151; was
unmoved by the weight of palpable uncertainty which Nalantei felt as
a binding cloak, cinched at her chest.</p>
<p>
"Come, daughter," said Partuala.  "Nalantei is
waiting."  Kioban's steps were a dance as she followed her
mother.</p>
<p>
"I am the masigiu tree," she said.  "My roots will
soothe her.  I am the longososi too that she will have little pain. 
May I help her dress?  Is she dressed?"  Nalantei could not
greet them as they crouched to enter the hut where she supported
herself, leaning back on her hands, helpless to design the near
minutes, impious to the women, even to her mother, Sienti, who rubbed
her fingers together and turned to spit in impatience.  Kioban stood
as if bound before her friend, her eyes widening to the near darkness
inside, to the muting of first light's rustle and song and to
Nalantei, older by three years and in the sorcery of change, already
draped in new goat skins, glistening in ocher and fat.  Nalantei
could sense the image &#151; created from the magic of dust, smoke and
morning mist within the hut &#151; that Kioban would assess: the older
girl, Nalantei herself, no longer the graceful companion and quiet
consort but a form in metamorphosis, as near to destruction as to
birth or rebirth.  Nalantei was ashamed at being observed, of being
earthbound and helpless in her colorful molting (this failure of
freedom) and watched the younger girl's eyes grow in the voluble
intensity of astonishment, knowing that she was observed through the
same diffusion of sunlight that always begins behind Kulal, engulfing
that broad expanse like a shroud, battling among the palm fronds of
the hut, to find her own half closed restive eyelids . . . a weak
speckled light, yet enough to summon the women, and wide-eyed Kioban
with her questions.</p>
<p>
"She is beautiful but strange," said Kioban.  "Why is
she strange?"  Partuala guided her daughter closer.  
</p>
<p>
"You know your friend.  Nalantei has taken milk for the last
time from her mother, and is dressed for the ceremonies.  Is she not
the shining moon in the new skins that I sewed for her?  Is she not
the image of worthiness?"</p>
<p>
"But I want to know her again, I want to know her."</p>
<p>
Nalantei was not moving but for her breath which was rapid and
shallow like a small animal.</p>
<p>
"Why is she so quiet?  Is she afraid?  I wish I might lie with
her and also be pure in Ngai."</p>
<p>
"What are you saying, child!" said Partuala.  "Let her
prepare.  Remember that you are here by the dispensation of the
elders, and may be sent away."</p>
<p>
Other footsteps and voices approached, the words of little meaning,
their presence and attention a mute message.  The women were
watching.</p>
<p>
Nalantei was lucid, but resolved in her silence among the women,
observing the quiet that she had practiced so well in recent weeks. 
Then, just as she closed her eyes against sight and the clamor of new
voices, her mother's command was clear:</p>
<p>
"Stand now," Sienti said, and Nalantei rose to find Kioban
rising with her, standing nearer than either attending mother wished,
as if to share Nalantei's day, to shine with her and reflect her
color.</p>
<p>
"It will be soon now," said Kioban.  "They will not
hurt you.  They may not hurt you.  Do not be afraid . . . it is
always well.  It will all be well."  The older women were
grateful for the lie from the child, a lie which they would not
utter, the assurance in deception that they might wish to convey, but
could not. 
</p>
<p>
"Are you sad?" asked Kioban.  Sienti realized in discomfort
that Kioban's question was addressed to her, and that the
child's eyes searched her for understanding.  Sienti and
Partuala might have laughed, but Kioban's focus, her child-dark
stare, did not waver.</p>
<p>
"It is not a time to be sad.  A marriage is a time of
joyfulness."</p>
<p>
The women were watching.  Coalescing and circling, their footsteps
were like the delicate padding of cheetahs in the bush.   The voices
rose as an insinuation of forgotten pain and suppressed anger, the
morning rustle and flow from which Nalantei could no longer hide. 
Sienti led her out where she stood, silently, as a presentation among
the women, their voices audible to her as if she were not a being of
sentiment, but an insensible image before them: 
</p>
<p>
". . .  Did she sleep?  Has she had the milk?"</p>
<p>
"I had forgotten how tall she has become."</p>
<p>
"Do you see her eyes?"</p>
<p>
"I had forgotten, but I was like her, once."</p>
<p>
"He is gone, is he not?  There was no question of that."</p>
<p>
"And
did <I>you</I> share your mat with
another last night?" 
</p>
<p>
"It is said that she has little skill in building and thatching
and the mission has made her aloof and proud."</p>
<p>
"What do you know of skills?  She knows more than her age
suggests." 
</p>
<p>
"Her color is so good!" 
</p>
<p>
"But she was so often alone, her nature is not so easily
changed, or broken."</p>
<p>
"Do you see her eyes?"</p>
<p>
"Partuala, why is Kioban here?  I know they were friends, but it
is not permitted.  Your daughter is not Ngaibartani and must wait
with the other girls and join in the children's songs with the
muran in the higher light, later this day, after the elder kills the
ox."</p>
<p>
"Yes, she shines but does not show herself to advantage. . .  Do
you see her eyes?"</p>
<p>
"I was like her once, I remember . . ." 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, he has gone, the two of them left, surely during the
night:  Lesanta, the one called Francis, and the other muran, Kimiti,
both of them &#151; weak speared with more courage in song than in
action, our flaccid warriors." 
</p>
<p>
"She is not so tall as slender, but her color is good."</p>
<p>
"I was like her, long ago."      
</p>
<p>
"Yes, in the last hour she stood with her mother, and took her
last milk."</p>
<p>
"It is not to any of us that a curse is due . . . do you hear?"</p>
<p>
"I do not see her eyes." 
</p>
<p>
"Did you hear the muran singing for our elder visitors?  It was
not the song of admiration and goodwill that they might have
expected." 
</p>
<p>
"I
heard them at nightfall.  I would laugh but that they sang so well. 
Let <I>us</I> curse the elders with our
women's voices for all the good it does us.  We will teach the
warriors how to sing; we will teach them how to curse." 
</p>
<p>
"Mother, you have done well with Nalantei.  She is quiet and
respectful and shines in her beauty like rain upon the face of a
cow." 
</p>
<p>
"I want to see her eyes, do you see her eyes?"  Sienti
finally spoke to them with the pride Nalantei had known in her own
song and story but could not assume:</p>
<p>
"This day our daughter will marry.  The moon and the stars are
true and the hour is right for her to become what we have become, and
form the new bonds of clan and husband of a purified woman.  I have
held her as my child but she will no longer take milk from my cattle
as from me.  This woman, who is a mother, (Partuala) and the young
teacher also, will hold her as sponsors. . .  Where is that one?"</p>
<p>
"I am here friend," said Nirolol, now called Teresa, who
emerged from the assembled women.</p>
<p>
"From this day, daughter, this mother who will hold your back,
and the . . . mother-teacher who will hold your right leg, will be
godmothers to you and your children.  Do you understand?" 
Nalantei was assumed to have given assent as she met her mother's
eyes but returned to the gentle vision of Teresa, who stepped forward
with a leather cape draped over her left arm and a pair of new
sandals in her right hand, her gifts to the one who would leave them
in marriage.  Nalantei felt her own face warming and the beginning of
tears at the sight of the one woman who had stayed with her on days
weighted with fear and confusion when her mother could not, who sang
with her and held her without words through those motherless nights
when she was like the school children in their blessing of the Mary
statue &#151; whose arms were stretched upward in her ever youthful sad
beckoning, her belly flat, but without tears, silent in the death of
her son, the Jesus, whose beard made him look older than she.  It was
proper that Teresa should hold her again in this rite of purity, and
give her the shoes that would trail the dust of Loiyangalani to her
new home. 
</p>
<p>
Teresa waited for the preparations to be complete, and sat with some
of the younger mothers near the hut.  It was not that the fire burned
newly to Teresa and the others in their new clan and home, but the
shining knife was sensation too, as were the visible trappings of new
ground ocher, and the seti sticks placed over the entranceway to
Sienti's expanded hut as a sign, the knowledge that their song
would soon begin, the ox would die and the muran come to sing and
dance; these too they must remember, no matter how weak their
convictions.  Before them the visual harshness softened to their
memories: the mother, the daughter, the milk and the fire &#151; a
local demarcation, a circle of odor and taste and song in that glint
of the morning light that remained as a flicker within them.</p>
<p>
They all agreed that it was done well.  The old woman of the Ltorobo
clan had arrived from Kulal exhausted from the heat, but with aged
hauteur sharpened her knife well before the first light, the sound
unmistakable to all who were near, the swiping regularity which the
men so fully associated &#151; not only with their own ritual
circumcision in adolescence, but perhaps of a battle or a dance,
spears and knives sharpened in the quest &#151; that they lay awake
frowning quietly in disgust at the persistent grinding of blade on
stone, the labor of blacksmiths; and the women were made all but sick
by the rhythm of metal on leather, that pulling and grasping in
breath-worn determination like the haggard coital heaving of an old
man . . . though familiar, at almost any other time an indifferent
conjuring.  They despised the old Ltorobo woman, the daughter of bee
keepers and a descendant of the vanquished and dispersed Laikipiak
Maasai of the previous century, corrupt of lineage and disdainful of
true Nkanyit.</p>
<p>
The pounding in Nalantei's chest was the smaller sphere to which
she was resolved, as she considered her world from the larger,
observing passionately.  It was her life that flew hotly, her body
poised for the attack to which she must submit, as she witnessed her
thoughts too, from the larger sphere, her mind restraining her body,
roiling in its circumvented flight.  She felt herself lifted: a rough
hand firmly, too firmly, held her right arm; other hands projected
her head upward as her limp weight resisted &#151; fingers pressed into
her back with no warmth through the red ochered goat skins about her,
and she was aloft; only the points of fingers touched her as the
leather clothing fell away from her back, drawn to earth, hanging for
a moment from coarse familiar fingers until released &#151; and her
feet were cold too as they touched the floor, as she must step, one
step only, and balance on one foot to lean forward, bow to the
opening of the hut (the larger sphere gone, pierced in her egress)
and rise again among the eyes of the women.  Nalantei moved a little,
opening her eyes and closing them, finding no point of focus.  Her
jaw was set in tight motions of unarticulated song so that her cheeks
bulged from clenched muscles and teeth beneath.  As her body and
spirit withered she felt the hands of Sienti and Partuala lifting her
arms so that they extended upward as in supplication.  They removed
the goat cloak so that she stood naked before them all, resigned and
silent in the grey mists of morning.  For the second time that day
the nkarau of milk, diluted with water from the spring, was brought
forward and a few drops of liquid moistened her head and dripped down
to one coiled copper earring and to the sheep skin at her feet.  She
felt the cold stiffness of the dry skins as she was lowered to sit,
and her feet were cold too as new fingers clasped more warmly about
the calf and knee of her right leg to hold her.  Rougher fingers held
her shoulders as she leaned back to the sacrifice beneath the first
light of the sun. 
</p>
<p>
"May
Ngai bless you, may Ngai bring you peace."  The women stood
watching, each with a full knowledge of the event as the Ltorobo
woman leaned myopically toward Nalantei's body; she moved her
knife slowly with the rhythm of an artist, deliberately, as her mouth
moved in a corresponding rhythm.  Nalantei lay silent and nearly
motionless, her legs outstretched, her eyes glazed as in a trance,
her breath shallow and quick as her heart raced heavily to changing
images. There might be pain, but it was deeper than a knife's
measure.  Her heart struck louder than a broken song, though she was
silent, and her head filled with a rage of voices, each with a color
and an odor, beating . . . it might have been a drum, like those that
the mission children heard, intoned by one child graced by the
priest, the white Laibon, that regular but imperfect rhythm in a
child's hands, an entreaty beat in joyfulness which she knew &#151; as
they marched, singing down the aisle at church &#151; the drum's
entreaty to the orphaned ones, sponsored to the mission, grown to
smile and return a smile, and a boy in black skins who was
transformed to the call of a kudu horn and became her warrior.  She
closed her eyes, but she could see:<B> 
</B>There was the blasphemy in her longed-for happiness and guilt in
her body's disposition to love.  Yet if it might be, she would
sin, and sin again, even to the death that stones bring, without
redemption; she would endure until her moon's night was new. 
And there was a face, not the boy, but a man, arms wrought to hold
her, familiar but silent; but did he smile as he held her?  She knew
that the strange time was near, when, upon the final cut of the knife
and her release into womanhood, a man may come,  according to custom,
swift and strong, who acts in secret and alone to kill his ox before
her hut and make a marriage.  The ox dies, and in its thick and
darkening blood the marriage is made beyond the refutation of the
elders.<B>  </B>Was he sleeping and unaware, did he laugh like the
boy, near her but forgetting?  The face resolved into the fire of
sunrise, a taunting hope behind her crimson eyelids, and she knew
him.  The image was her father, Perean, the eyes severe but saddened,
he who could do nothing, so cruel, so distant . . .   
</p>
<p>
 In answer to Nalantei's silence, one woman frowned, "What
does this girl know of pain to be so proud?  Let her give birth first
and then act the young warrior.  Are we to bow to this great moment
of courage as to a boy warrior who sings the Lebarta?  She will have
her time.  Let her lose a child as my mother did, as her mother
Sienti herself has, then let her be so proud."   After a few
moments the old woman poured the dilute milk again over the small
knife and softly touched the forehead of her charge, who started just
noticeably to the touch and focused her eyes.  Nalantei caught for a
moment a vision of age that had a certain tenderness, a face that was
worn and lined with sun-drawn furrows but held no malevolence, or
indeed pity.  In the sharply defined bones of the Ltorobo woman's
face and the brightness of her focus, Nalantei saw an image of beauty
not lost to years.  She closed her eyes again.</p>
<p>
As the old woman rose, Sienti said, "It is done, daughter,"
and the women turned away, silent in contemplation for moments only. 
Nalantei moved a little, and blinked.  As she looked about, almost
expectantly, the image of the Ltorobo woman which she sought was
gone.  Nalantei remained estranged from her body as the spirits all
retreated &#151; boy, man, and age.</p>
<p>
Was she like a boy as the women said, who yearns for the freedom of
the muran?  Or was she a woman in forced consent, beyond the
perceptions of a child who must follow in misery's footsteps
because there is no other path &#151; with the acquiescence of the
feral captive that only awaits release, quietly attending that
liberation may come, must come? &#151; a woman's consent to follow
an unfamiliar print to an unknown land, without reason but that the
elders, whose grim eyes peer beneath their strange hats, command as
earthly lords, for it is their way and therefore hers, following the
will of Ngai.  
</p>
<p>
If she had the courage of a young muran, why was there no song, no
Lebarta of pride and celebration to which a father would rise as to a
boy in black?  There was no gift of a cow &#151; no gift and no joy. 
Her eyes burned in the absence of her father, Perean, her champion. 
</p>
<p>
The woman all agreed that it was done well, even in those short
minutes passing where her blood dropped steadily upon the lamb skin
beneath her &#151; this pure blood, and the other. 
</p>
<p>
The clamor about her had been the holiday as she who waited was the
cause, material and final, the object but not the form.  The elders
were near but would not yet approach, and there would be no secret
man, no special drama.  The boy her warrior, Francis, was gone, and
her father had not yet appeared.  Returned to the hut, she lay in a
curl.  Soon other women, wives and mothers, would gather near her
unprotected sphere; she might be a cat for whom sleep is essence,
noted and accepted, or a dying goat, for their affective speech &#151; that
which was quick was now meat, no kick, no jump, eyes clouded without
dissent, silent but for her short breath and her active eyes, cloaked
from their purpose. 
</p>
<p>
The women were watching.  It was their time, before the muran came to
dance, before the feast and the elders' evening rites.
