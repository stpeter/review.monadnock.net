<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>
<!--
<h5>(Page 13 of 16)</h5>
<p>
Nalantei wondered at her own familiarity with the stars which did not
reflect the difference of the land, but rose as a sad memory of her
childhood, less changing than the sea, too constant in their turning,
though obscured to the east by Kulal which rose like a dark shield,
but rarely hid the moon which was, must be, older than she, thinly
cloaked by clouds, its brilliance induced by the vagrant sun.  She
wondered that she knew the cycle of the moon, remembering there were
white turned pages with the syllables of distant peoples which
flashed before her but were only curiosities in their irrelevancy. 
She knew but was unsure why she knew that the moon was cold and shone
in its cycles with reflected light.  The words were her own, not
those of the mission or the Turkana, or the muran in secretive
darkness, or those of the threatening Laibon, the priest, with his
hard white walls, his simpering women and his knife.  There would be
no day for such words.</p>
<p>
"It has been four years since the last Ilmugit ceremony,"
said Naperu to the assembled women, "and you see them gather
near our daughters, drawn like birds to water, anxious and
determined.  It cannot be long, perhaps two more years, until the
elders will permit their marriage, and my dear son must be first
among them."</p>
<p>
Said one to Naperu: "It is his honor, friend to be chosen among the
muran of many settlements to be Launoni.  He has carried his position
with vigor and firmness."  In a few moments they all laughed.</p>
<p>
"What they carry and who they serve is known to us all,"
said another wife.  "But the elders will not give up their
privileges until they are too weak to follow their wives, with their
feet or with their eyes."  Several of the women looked toward
Nalantei, who laughed with them, as if the inference could not
include herself.</p>
<p>
"We will leave this place in a few days,"  Naperu said. 
"There will be no dancing and it is certain that the muran will
attend us only for the sake of our cattle, at least until the new
moon.  The sun is high and the earth has hardened.  But there will be
grass and the path will be clear in our passage to the springs above
the lake."</p>
<p>
The constituent matter of huts was piled high on donkeys and the four
camels. Small herds of cattle, goats and sheep were watered and
guided by boys and muran for the two day journey northwest, the
farthest reach of any settlement, yet still near the lake shore,
where these Samburu of the Lngwesi clan might guard and nourish their
stock on the coarse but abundant grasses, that there would be milk,
and where the doum palm and sansevieria grow, that Nalantei could
build her own hut and be a wife.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
  Lake Turkana had risen many meters in the preceding weeks, fed from
the north by the expanding delta of the Omo river, like thickened
arteries from the heart of southern Ethiopia, fed even from the arid
west by the Turkwel, and from the east by springs which had grown to
bank-cascading torrents off Kulal.  The geode-strewn broad barren
shore was submerged, waters reaching the higher ground of the grass
mounds and proud ensconced bolder sentries which stood in wait for
their drama in evening shadows.  The breccia of dormant volcanoes on
South Island, like shards of ancient pottery &#151; swept to the shore,
creaking in high alto grinding and rolling &#151; was not rounded or
dissolved, but remained as sharp as a viper's fangs.  Many
weaver bird nests had been torn from their tethered branches, crushed
and dispersed, only to be rebuilt in a new world, the destruction not
regretted . . . just forgotten.  Lake Turkana shone deep green below
the new settlement which was established on high ground among ancient
lava cones.  The rough road northward passed below too, where the
rare four-wheel-drive vehicle raged past toward the Sibiloi reserve
or Koobie Fora, though there would be no travelers for some time
because of the rains.  
</p>
<p>
Loiyangalani, only a four hour walk away did not exist as Nalantei
looked southward.  South Island rose in the distance, and westward,
on the opposite shore far off, the grey hills and sullen sky hung
over Turkanaland, stretching west and north in unceasing reverence to
a Samburu's foreboding.  The Turkana do not raid this far north
on the east side of the lake, they have told her, and the Somali
shifta have not attacked in years.  Yet she would not run to the
shore alone, in fear of the treachery of the grass mounds, that there
might be jackals in waiting for a fall, or vipers, warmed and alert
in the morning sun.  But no grey clad Turkana women, their hair bound
in angry tufts, would cross her path, no women, tall and strong,
glaring in hate-filled disapproval . . . nor would their men
approach, Turkana fishermen whose filament-torn sails were the web of
deceit &#151; men uncut, unpurified like their women, cold and strong,
whom Ngai could never love.</p>
<p>
"The lake is reaching out to us," said Maluni.</p>
<p>
"It
is a new lake," Nalantei said.  "I have never seen it
before. The poor fishermen's settlement on the shore will have
been moved westward.  I do not see them.  And Lmolo Island <I>is</I>
an island again. "</p>
<p>
"The water of the lake will be fresher," said Maluni.  "We
will swim together soon."</p>
<p>
"Is it safe for us to walk to the shore?"  Nalantei asked. 
She listened as the light breeze stroked her hair and moved through
the beads and buttons on her head and lifted the light metal
ornament &#151; which touched her forehead like a blessing.</p>
