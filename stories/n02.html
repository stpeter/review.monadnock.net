<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>

<h4>Part I: Nkanyit and the Girl (July)</h4>
<h5>(Page 2 of 16)</h5>
<p>
<I>Whose voice is that I hear, is someone calling?</I></p>
<p>
"Nalantei, listen to me, child."  It has begun.  The
shadows are deepening and she knows the voice that will hold her.</p>
<p>
"Sir?"</p>
<p>
"What is a flower?"</p>
<p>
"A flower?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, a simple thing to ask, what is a flower?"  His eyes
meet hers in the remoteness of the question; he does not hesitate,
but is solemn and focused in the initial formality of his duty.  She
finds herself in an unwonted indignity, lying prostrate, in shame,
awakened before a man, an elder, thrust into the present in wonder
that her body's pain is not a memory and not a dream.  In the
color of his following eyes the man holds little remembrance of pain
for her, or love, yet she is bound by the entreaty of his gaze and
the demand of his voice.  Still, pain grasps her as in anger,
possesses like a claw; in this awakening, sensation is dominant,
resolving finally into an almost human form.. 
</p>
<p>
"Answer me, Nalantei.  What is a flower?"</p>
<p>
"It is the color of joyfulness."</p>
<p>
"Yes, that is true, but is it not first a thing that grows? 
Have they taught you well, daughter, to know that beauty comes of
growth, and yielding to your nature?"     
</p>
<p>
"We do not see flowers commonly."</p>
<p>
"Listen to me, Nalantei!  You will walk from us tomorrow and all
that you carry is yourself and some remembrance of your clan here. 
You will see us rarely.  The Samburu of Loiyangalani will no longer
be your family.  I am here to teach you as no elder has done.  Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, but I am not so fit for learning."</p>
<p>
"You are, and must be, daughter, as this is your time."</p>
<p>
"But I hurt, and my stomach is . . ." 
</p>
<p>
"We know your stomach and your heart are strong.  You must
listen to me."</p>
<p>
"I will listen."</p>
<p>
"And answer as I bid you?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, and answer."</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Leaning day is in the wind.  Doum palm fronds are deeper green in
late shadows.  Familiar sprawling doubles bend &#151; rustling,
flowing, reaching out, but never to dissipation in the pure perceived
air &#151; yet soften as the broad and spotted land dissolves.  An
angularity of human forms progresses; silhouettes at a distance wave
against the sky and the Jade Sea &#151; wave if a palm and walk if a
man, just distinguishable.  The sun's descent on the western
hills beyond the lake is for some moments a blinding scarlet,
screaming at a distance an old but not forgotten desert threat, of
tribal raids, of cattle lost.  In this too brilliant reflected light
the Samburu must turn to the east and the darkening giant, Mount
Kulal, its broad form blending long into the evening air.  This
clarity of the sky, passing from a day of unimpeded sunlight into
budding starlight, fulfills a contract with the mountain which, with
the regularity of a bellows primed, projects the cooling air and
darkness in a dry withering gale, a protracted avalanche of wind,
sweeping past huts and palms out beyond the shore of Lake Turkana in
measured pulses until the morning light.  But the evening's
broken calm portends no rage, as color fades and is forgotten in
muted tones in this rest of earthly distinctions.  The sky is clear
as fire-lights are tended anew.  The day is in the wind.  
</p>
<p>
Yet where there is a voice there is a song.  
</p>
<p>
Nalantei lies, raised as on a low altar in her mother's hut of
palm.  Voices intrude upon her consciousness.  The words repeat,
advancing and dispersing again &#151; voices in a dream and voices that
command, all in the haze of an old fire.  It is to be the elders'
night, and their words will possess her, because the man, Sopoitan,
has killed his ox before her hut, and in this act, made an
incontestable marriage.  
</p>
<p>
Six elders sit, crowded near Nalantei in a half circle, opposite the
weak fire.  Nalantei's mother, Sienti, is silent and resentful
among the elders, having of necessity granted them dominion in her
home.  The young mother, Teresa, Nalantei's friend and teacher,
sits by the entranceway.  In this unnatural association Teresa must
support the new wife, Nalantei, but is apprehensive herself among the
elders, knowing that she will soon be banished from this hut as the
rituals proceed and night winds rise. 
</p>
<p>
For Nalantei there is peace where consciousness wanes; there are
moments when the local threat, though discernable, is withdrawn.  Her
sentience is a palm which rests in evening shadows, inured and
ignorant of the torment which is an inescapable cycle.  She is a
woman now, Ngaibartani: purified, razed of god, and a wife.</p>
<p>
 "Nalantei . . . Nalantei, you know me, do you not?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"And who am I?"</p>
<p>
"An elder and age-mate of my father."</p>
<p>
"What is my name?  Do not be afraid.  You may say it."</p>
<p>
"You are called Lekapana."</p>
<p>
"I am Lekapana, as you say, who has known you since your birth,
as I am your father's second.  In my forty-eight years I have
lived among my cattle at Mount Kulal and have walked to the summit of
 Mount Ng'iro, and have blooded my spear as a warrior.  I have
seen the years of drought and the better years when the rains came
calmly without a flood, when I shared the meat of my oxen in Ilmugit
celebration only to see the dark answer of the rinderpest, when with
our full stomachs we watched the falling bodies of our cattle, all in
waste; or then again, I have lived when the rivers ran in anger as if
disturbed from sleep or death, and buried men and cattle, and it
seemed that the prayers of so many to Ngai for rain were answered in
dark laughter as the earth was broken and our wells were submerged. 
But I have learned the purpose of his will.  Ngai is love.  In only
hours the raging plunder was finished.  It was the cause that the
grasses grew to feed our cattle and goats and donkeys.  And I have
seen a certain courage:  A flower rose in the resolved but broken
soil, beginning as a thin stem, but growing in its way toward
sunlight to find color in fulfillment such that its race would live. 
But I have also seen a stem wither in an unpropitious place in
drought and never reach its purpose.  Do you understand?  Nalantei,
it is not enough that you grow, and your new color is not the end of
your growing.  Do you know what you are?"  
</p>
<p>
"I am a flower."</p>
<p>
She
thinks perhaps this is what it means to be a woman.  But in this rite
of anguish and imminent removal she has become more than a visual
object, a bloom in the dust, more than a creature of local birth who
flits among the elders as a living distraction to deeper purpose &#151; a
sylvan fly, a dust-grey bird &#151; but now truly a soul sharing in
some way that purpose of the elders, if only a taste, a touch.  Might
it be granted that she too observes the same squint to light's
angle, too sharp at dusk over Lake Turkana, and when it begins, the
tilt to darkness?  And might <I>they</I>
apprehend as she does the first fall of the Kulal bellows that bends
a brittle bush, and share a vision of the weaver bird &#151; sheltered
at the single Euphorbia, that feels the evening drift as a feather is
lifted on its back, yellow fading to grey (earth's color but not
essence) yet sings to the menacing shadows before his retreat to a
night-resisting nest to wait, small feet grasping as he swings
within, his hut tethered to the tree limb, suspended in the open
night air, in trust of the tether, (grass drying to inflexibility in
the same wind) bird made, floating &#151; now that they acknowledge
her, now that they must speak?  
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, do you know why we give you to this man?"</p>
<p>
"Because it is my time."  Lekapana rises to face her.  She
does not look at him but remains lying, propped on her side, with her
eyes nearly closed.</p>
<p>
"We give you to Sopoitan because he is a worthy man who will
care for you. . .  Do you know that we would not give you to a mean
man?"  Silence.  "Answer me, Nalantei, as this is a grave
time which you must never forget, the beginning of your second life,
and your family."</p>
<p>
"A grave time."</p>
<p>
"What do you say?  Do you know that Sopoitan is a worthy man who
has won the respect of the elders of our clan?"</p>
<p>
"You say so."</p>
<p>
"Do you doubt this?"</p>
<p>
"No."  
</p>
<p>
She hears in the distance the rhythm of young men, the warriors,
muran, whose dance is energy, hope, and the boasting of freedom.  It
is the marriage dance, and the muran sing in pride to the girls who
mock their pride, as all glow in the resonance of ochered passions. 
She may stand to observe but will not join them, though it is her
dance, an entreaty to joyfulness that wells deeply: the voices in
song rising, calling, falling deeply, a range from bovine to bird in
the punctuation of sandal slap and exhalations.  They leap high upon
thin long legs, knees nearly locked, as their taut calves, like
loaded springs, release them upward.  She recognizes through the
rising dust the most beautiful among them whose long braided hair,
red and shining, floats behind in the apex of a leap, much as the
muran themselves seem to float behind the smiles, behind the laughing
calls and shining sweat which forms like crystal beads on their
foreheads.  She wonders if they even think of her, Nalantei, who
might have been among them, who might have stood tall and quiet
behind the most colorful girls, her chin forward to show her soft
smooth neck, her hands grasping, pulsing, her whole body in motion to
the mounting intensity of song.  But as sound in distance lags and
dissipates, so her passion floats, her body weakened almost to
resigned consent, the sound more significant than the song.  Their
song is fragile, the words becoming indistinct until only the deep
drum of earth resounds from beneath their feet. ["Nalantei"]
She turns for the last time toward the dancers to watch one muran,
whose solo dance resembles the leaping of a widow bird, dark and
proud in ambition, as he strives to surmount the summit of pale
grasses. ["Nalantei"]</p>
<p>
<I>Whose voice is that I hear, is someone calling?</I>  
</p>
<p>
"Answer me, Nalantei, did you hear them when they first
approached our village?"</p>
<p>
"Who?"</p>
<p>
"These two men, here."</p>
<p>
"What men?"</p>
<p>
"These elders, your husband Sopoitan, and Lekiso, his second,
who sang.  Surely their voices were beautiful as they came to us
yesterday, singing as the morning rose.  Was it not so?   Everyone
said their song was the awakening from a perfect dream that such
beauty and love were expressed by them."</p>
<p>
"Yes, an awakening. . .  They sang well, I remember."</p>
<p>
"The clan elders of the Lngwesi all commend Sopoitan.  He is a
fine speaker and tends his cattle to great advantage.  He has wisdom
in age, and has a muran son and a daughter by the first wife, Naperu.
 Even today the junior elders seek his counsel.  Will you respect him
as he is due?"</p>
<p>
"As he is due."</p>
