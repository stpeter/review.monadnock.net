<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>

<p>
  Nalantei knew each spot upon their bodies and long faces, any
etching on a horn (one bull had been decorated in the Turkana style
as a dance ox), each one's characteristic gait and condition: all
were healthy and fattened by the new grasses and flowers after the
rains.  She walked, sometimes with a small boy, a cousin to Maluni,
enlisted to duty, down to the water hole nearer to the shore.  He
directed her cattle with a long thin stick, so secure in his command,
his diminutive frame a stricture and exclamation of human dominance,
his voice ringing in song.  Did she know the song?  The words and
sentiment were new, not taken from her dissolved past, a song that
was high and clear, broken sometimes by a deep growl as he called to
one or another (as when one dominant female butted another cow in
curious bovine malice), returning in an unbroken syllable, flowing
again like a stream of water past an immovable stone, his song
devolving into spoken words, though seldom to her, proud in his youth
like a muran though too young for their fancies; and he laughed . . .
at the cattle, and sometimes at her tenderness with them, as to sons
and daughters &#151; daughters who might stand as she among cattle that
only sons may inherit, sons who stand firm like words, exclamations
in duty and honor, graceful in form, yearning for their days of
freedom in the bush, multicolored birds that preen and fly &#151; and
she watched him whisk his thin long stick against the lethargy of the
cattle, resolute almost, his red patterned cloth loose about him, a
small knife held at his waist by a strip of goat skin; she watched as
he spit quickly and accurately though the gap between his lower
teeth, almost serene, though a child.  Perhaps there would be sons
for whom these cattle would prosper, sons more animate than the dust
and grasses, not to be stolen, not to be bound in cloth and wood and
assumed by Ngai , but to live . . . or a girl child to rest against
her back as she worked, to sit by her in the quiet night, for whom
there would be songs and stories, new ones, beyond the memory of the
elders, and distinct too &#151; a child that might run . . . 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, in the children's voices &#151; in the pitch and
inflection of Maa, in the arbitrary exclamations of their play &#151; she
missed the rhythm of a drum beat, the steady pace of a procession  .
. . there had been a ceiling, vaulted from poles of palm, and the
gathering of so many faces, children sitting or kneeling by wooden
benches, even some Turkana women holding their infants, strong and
intransigent, spitting in the aisle, volatile as their nursing
children, the drum beat ceasing so that all would sit or stand on the
benches facing the white Laibon, attending the raised arms and cupped
extended fingers, and the morsel of bread . . . and the
mother-teacher's soft eyes.  
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The lake was silent, shimmering far below as the women sat in an
afternoon's turning, sharing distilled moments of soon passed
hours, consorting in a broken circle, sipping sweet tea.  Nalantei
attended Nting'idua as she carefully lay her sleeping child on a
shaded goat skin nearby.  The women were watching.  An older woman
asked Nting'idua,</p>
<p>
"Friend, he comes to you already, does he
not?  We see it, though he may not wish us to."</p>
<p>
"Yes, it is a happy time, I am healed from the birth."  
</p>
<p>
Nalantei had heard the sentiment from others, from ones who could
speak of it among the women, that the wife, Nting'idua, loved
her man.  Her father had not intervened when the two met at a wedding
dance, and now with this, her fourth child, her life remained as an
endless blessing.  Nalantei observed the young mother, Nting'idua,
who was only a few years older than herself, to explore her deepest
nature.  They would smile to each other, but spoke little as
Nting'idua was rarely alone, never in the evening.  The other
women did not speak of her often.  But Nting'idua could laugh
alone, apart from them, with a joy they did not share and could not
understand.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 That evening, working alone in the raw skeleton of her hut, Nalantei
perceived, as if from the broken clarity of clear water, a young man,
ambiguous of office, neither bright-plumed warrior bird nor elder,
standing near her again like a tall stone against sea waves.  His
hair held only a trace of red ocher.  He carried no spear and
approached alone, but would not merely stand, as his demeanor was
purposeful, portentous.</p>
<p>
"I am his son," he said.  "Among the Lngwesi muran, I
am Launoni.  Naperu, the first, is my mother."  She must turn to
him now, this youthful sentinel whose image she had so well avoided,
and suppressed.  "Since the last Ilmugit, these past four years,
I have walked far with my friend who will be Laibon.  The Lmasula
clan, from whom  I see you have come, welcomed me to Mount Ng'iro,
where from its highest rocks I sang in praise of Ngai."  She
could not hold his focused incendiary gaze, but did not turn away,
held as helplessly as a captive bird by his words.  "I have
watched you," he said in deliberate tones.  "Did you never
see me?"</p>
<p>
"Was
it really you?"  she asked.  He might have spoken of the past
weeks when he considered her, with curiosity at first, from a
distance, seeing her among the women, following her image as she
walked or sat working a goat skin with his sister, Maluni.  He might
have spoken of his growing fascination with her delicate steps and
the clear lines of her face, much like his own, or praised the
refinement of her craft as she kneeled, weaving the continuous
circles of her hut, praising her for who she was &#151; though not
exactly for <I>what</I> she was.  They
did not need to speak of trust, of the weight of such words in this
single confidence.</p>
<p>
"Will you stay among us long?" she asked. 
</p>
<p>
"You and the elder, my father, will be blessed, and I have
promised to witness."</p>
<p>
"I am sorry for that."</p>
<p>
"Nalantei," he said, speaking her name for the first
time &#151; which at once startled and further saddened them both &#151; "I
am sorry too that it should be so." As tears formed in his eyes
she could see the turmoil within, the rage and despair woven tightly,
inextricably.  For a moment he wavered, his consciousness of the
present faltering, his eyes relinquished to another place as if to
confront the welling of emotions, to live it finally, seeking
resolution before a lost and unattainable future.  He turned, and
from deep inside his chest he emitted a low moan, which rose and
collapsed with sudden intensity as he clenched his hands.  There
would be no ndokuna of a young warrior, but one battle against his
nature from which he might garner the courage for others to come.  An
old sound had returned to him, and with it the scent of a popping
fire and evening's approach as he sat among fellows at a
blessing: milk droplets burning like sparks from the fire, like the
white burning of cold stars amid the faltering of so many hearts in
the repeating blast of a kudu horn, as young muran collapsed like
bleeding goats, released to wild incomprehension, and the sound, the
word, repeated in the tumult, more exhortation than command, from
many voices and many places, "Nkanyit," they called, but
the stars faded in the brightened sky, and he had not fallen, but
turned again to her, the word repeating in whispered determination to
himself, alone.  
</p>
<p>
And she awaited him, Nalantei, who could not help, drawn to him more
in conscious empathy than in truly shared emotion, floating within
her protected circle &#151; passion in remembrance even then as the
star splatter of Nkanyit's storm wrought its promised reward
upon the aging muran . . . yet even then her eyes would not grace
him, but only the shore below, following footprints laid before her,
observing, removed and without fear, the threatening tufts of grass,
the unknowable pits within the dark sand soil, the hyena and the
serval cat (who take no notice), the fishermen, worn in the sustained
heat of the afternoon who may reach the shore, and the children, who
explode from huts like bees toward her sweetness . . .</p>
<p>
"I can only wonder," he said, "that I could ever live
to such a day and such a sacrifice, that I can aspire to love, and in
forgetting, even dream a father's death."</p>
