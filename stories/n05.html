<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 5 of 16)</h5>
<p><em>Whose voice is that I hear, is someone calling?</em></p>
<p>"Nalantei, the voices you hear are only our own.  Only we the elders, with Sopoitan your husband, speak."  Still she may not move.  "You who are no longer a child. . .do you fear our words?  As days pass you will walk with this man, Sopoitan, your husband.  You will not forget us, the elders of your childhood.  We will live with you as spirits in a dream might live, that call in the night, that flash in a fire.  Our words in Nkanyit will endure.  We are in your blood.  It is your father that has made you, and now this man your husband will hold you in your future.  This is our way."  Nalantei, paralyzed in her waking, says, "I do not know my body; why do you hold me?  What I see is flowers in a flame."</p>
<p>As a child, Nalantei watched her father, Perean, and focused on the mystery of his voice until she understood the words, the song, without questioning as he spoke of his youth: of his far cast wanderings as a muran deep into the Chalbi desert with Lekapana, his friend, each carrying only a spear and rungu, a club, and a little milk, soon soured, &#151; to capture a gerenuk in sudden frantic flight, caught in a sling as it stood full upright to taste the dry leaves among the thorns, its meat strong and pungent &#151; and then southward, walking all the way to Wamba where there was more than one street, and many who were no longer Samburu but covered themselves in the rough cloth of the town; of the beautiful cattle that his brother kept for him near Mount Kulal and the other ones taken in a raid, though Perean never blooded his spear, nor had he killed a lion, which were few even then.  He showed delight in his memory of the days of his muranhood; he had seen the world and loved to speak of it, but always wanted children, he said, sons and daughters, to tell it, all of it, that they might know him and remember, and for whom he would build his herd.  But Sienti could give him only this girl, Nalantei herself, only this blessing, and her living vituperation.  Perean did not stay often with Sienti, but those were the nights Nalantei loved as she lay awake to the sounds of his breath, the swelling and groaning in a rhythm complementary to the wind &#151; in time, almost, to the wind's torrent shiver among the dry palms.</p>
<p>Sometimes in late evening she had watched him as he slept, and wondered at his body, the tight coiled potential of sinew held in reserve, energy at peace &#151; minutes before the wind, before the crash of waves upon an island, before the leap of a gazelle, just so poised.  In sleep his legs were crossed just as when he stood, (leaning on a stick as a man always does, his weight upon one foot) as if to protect himself, his man's parts &#151; even in their rest, lying upon his thigh, humble and quiet in delicate motion, a sort of flow it seemed.  Her fingers imagined him warm and firm, or then again soft and cool like her own cheek, the little sacks too, like a goat's softness or that calf-like smoothness of the skin under a camel's shoulder that the Rendille prize . . . not to hurt him, because even a man must feel pain if he can feel pleasure, but just to hold and squeeze and feel the blood pulse inside (perhaps like the pull to a heifer's teat that draws milk so strongly) . . . not to anger him, but to follow, even in his sleep.</p>
<p>Awake at daybreak, he would stand and look at her as he did when she was silent and walked in the weeks just passed, the story raging yet in private song, his expression not angry, never angry, but full in the heart even to his gaze, the weight of moisture and color by magical firelight still revealing &#151; and she, not angry but resigned beyond tear making, and never, never to be wife to a Lkunone, a blacksmith elder (the bellows and the blade) and cursed, surely cursed as she would flee, cursed in his goat madness, his dark moon sorcery, better to a Laibon's son in youthful presentation who does not curse a wife and is worthy, or the white Laibon himself, the priest and doctor who cures the swelling and the bloat, and heals women's bodies that they may live, endure like her mother, who never knew a silent time but thrust her sorrow outward in a scream and a slap, ocher red that on still water rippled in timeless circles, dissipating . . . though never before Perean, who is stronger than sorrow, than anger, and remains master of the silent circles &#151; or the broader rough water in which he stood without a cloth, the muscles on his arms and chest like the course of fevered streams that bring life; or alone, Perean the man, the father, warm firm and invigorated like a snake, or a dark stone standing in the sea so unafraid, plying the water like a boat in sail.  But she must leave him.</p>
<p>Nalantei had seen her father rise to walk in just-passed days in his like sadness, the steps perfect in pattern and symmetry as his form receded from her, he whose eyes pierced like the face of a leopard, who circled before he lay, out in the full sun upon a rock without defense of spears, lay loosely in his rest, naked in his color without disposition to leap or strike, his matter contained, reserved in strength, his breath clear and heavy.  Nalantei remembered his kiss, the coarse hair on his face which pierced her so joyously . . . but this was so long ago.  And she heard yet again the women chattering furtively to themselves, when Sienti rose in anger at their words, and begged Perean to stay away in the hours of the high sun, to quell suspicions.  But Nalantei knew the women clamored together to support each others claims, their words the harsh piercing of injustice: that he slept with her . . . that all elders are corrupt in body and, lacking cattle sufficient for a second wife, wish to lie with their daughters, that Nalantei was given too much freedom by Perean and spoke openly before him, that he did not stop her arrogance but encouraged her, yes often, to speak and to walk alone even after sunset with only a knife like a muran, "just to see."  The elder, Perean, was too gentle with the girl, too tolerant, and her obdurate nature was the legacy of his unworthy attentions.  The languages, the mission learning, made her haughty and encouraged her to walk among the Turkana and Lmolo.  They agreed, all of them, that she must marry, must rid herself of Francis, the warrior of two worlds, the tourists' friend.</p>
<p>But the elders could not find her a husband.  The women said that her arrogance was known, and some spoke ill of her to the neighboring clans from which a husband must come.  But Nalantei's words rang again to her: on that day she screamed and shook and begged Perean to keep the man away from her, the blacksmith of the Lkunone clan &#151; so far from the life she knew &#151; and Perean assented to her plea.  But soon another came to ask for her, Sopoitan, who was a worthy man and strong, with many cattle.  Sopoitan would be generous to the wife-givers, and honor them.  They agreed, all of them &#151; sitting in a circle on an afternoon, standing in turn with stick raised to command attention &#151; that Sopoitan was a fine choice.  Her first fight remained as a shame which could not be compounded.  Why must she marry at all?   She did not wish to leave her home.  Not ever, not now.</p>
<p>The Lkunone elder did not bring a curse upon her or Perean in his loss as was feared, so it was to be done; Nalantei would be the second wife of Sopoitan, and though he was old, (he would be fifty-two in the first year of their marriage) there could be no further resistance.  Her hard won battle so suddenly engaged had been lost in this late skirmish.  She did not blame her father, knowing that as she grew she must change, even as the sinew of his flesh was more prominent and he sat longer with the other elders and moved with a paced deliberateness and did not dance and rarely sang; yet his kindness would surface as above the flat water of the lake in evening . . . even as her mother changed in obeisance to Nkanyit: her cheeks sunken, the skin of her arms becoming opaque and loose, her belly no longer expanding, as she, like the surface of the lake, receded in the sun, in the wind.  Nalantei recognized that it was her time, but in her only remaining mode of defiance, she turned from them, from all but . . .</p>
<p>. . . another voice which rose in distinctness, behind the cover of her eyelids and the woven circle of her capture, whose sponsored image brought her sadness:  Francis, her warrior, who had always approached the elders fearlessly.</p>
<p>She had heard his step and his song often among them as she waited for his visits in recent months, alone in her own hut nearby, on her sleeping mat, both sacred and profane.  She would furtively watch him as he questioned the men, as they teased him.  She thought that she had never seen such fervent eyes, which gathered the gestures of the elders; his whole body was so delicately composed, and his voice &#151; in words indistinguishable sometimes, trailing from one language to another &#151; was more song than speech.</p>
<p>She had seen him in an earlier time among the elders, not laughing with them, but solemn and firm in his bearing, his head shaven to a tuft, a boy in black skins, dark and secret, though she knew he knew that she watched him pass and wondered at the grace of his uneven pace, his impatient hand pulsing, always grasping, perhaps in rhythm to an inner song like her own &#151; serene and secret, secret even from her when she saw him among the fear-drawn, cattle praising, ndokuna stricken boys who in fury and fear bind together; he was more alone than they &#151; and was cut too, like herself, purified in honor to Ngai, and wore in that month his dark birds, but did not aim his gum tipped arrows at her legs, too proud, (because he already knew that she would want him?) or was it that he would not compete for her; and the girls teased him always because he walked in his own strange manner, because he did not shoot at their legs, would not fell the weaver birds but only starlings and barbets before the Ilmugit &#151; and after was a muran but chose the town and the effects of the town and the mission which saved his life.  His body was swift and with a grace she found a marvel, even in the slight trochee of his bounding step.  He seemed to sense her every motion, each turn of her head and glance, and to retain each one himself as if that point of her perception must be essential to his own, and she too became absorbed in their recommencement and looked to him, not for support or actualization (she was content with her solo world) but as a partner in points to hold as a commonplace.  Resting by large stones once surrounded by the lake, (now some walk from the shore in its daily retreat) they ran critical fingers over the ancient pictographs, naming the shapes and the animals, in wonder at giraffe and elephant that must have walked on the same shores in centuries past.  She was startled at his sudden motion toward her, her eyes wide as four short strands of new bright red beads rose over her head and lay resting around her neck and upon her chest as his eyes consumed her.  So many times they walked this way that the beads soon lay heavy upon her, each gift a weight upon her heart that brought tears of thanks that she might dance among the others as one who is loved, and sing in that new pride which blossomed above shame, beyond repentance. The cause was Francis.</p>
<p>Of the Wazungu, the travelers from other lands, he said, "They tell me many things.  They like to talk about themselves and I listen.  And they will listen to my  words too, for a time."  He told her that they all have photographs of their relatives that they carry in small folding leather bags with their money and their identities, and that he could see their pride.  He said that he could see them frown and laugh inwardly when he spoke of his cattle and goats, but he too could laugh at how little they know of the Samburu and the Turkana and Lmolo, that they know nothing of the land and trees and flowers even as they profess to admire them; he would smile at their fears, because there is so much that they fear, time principally &#151; they are so bound as to carry it with them always as if to verify each hour, that it not escape them, but that they have such cleverness that they make machines to sew, to write, and even for speaking, and their fire takes many forms.  They are often kind and he liked them, most of them, recognizing that they are lonely or would not travel so far; they are good and bad like all people, and even beautiful sometimes in their patch-sewn clothing.  Of the Turkana, he said, "Should there be an age where drought is final, when the Samburu disperse from starvation and fear, and when the world of men becomes like packs of angry dogs that die in the dust, it will be the Turkana who will stand alone and survive, because they have grown to exist on the western shore which is even now a most desolate land, yet they are dark and strong and will eat anything, and their numbers are great.  It is said that no Turkana will hurt another.  They are admirable."  Admirable! . . . the Turkana, who do not have Nkanyit?  But she learned to suspend fear and began to learn their words.</p>
<p>
But in hours apart from him there were voices in subtle acrimony,
from the women, that would question the virtue of the boy, Francis. 
When one day as Nalantei sat quietly with him, her brow lowered, he
asked her in English, "Are you unwell?" she answered in
Maa, "They say that the way you speak to the Turkana, and with
the government words, and with another voice to the white tourists,
that you hold words above Nkanyit.  You speak to the priest only in
Kiswahili, and to the white-draped women who follow him, the
&#145;sisters,' with the English voice.  Why do our women see
you this way?  Why do they warn me against you?"</p>
<p>
"Their words are of no importance."</p>
<p>
"Is it the words, the new words of the mission and the Laibon?"</p>
<p>
"These are no voices to earn your fear, and you should not let
the fear in others weaken your heart," he said.  "I know
that words are my freedom."</p>
<p>
"But why do you care so much for the words?  Is the tongue of
the Samburu which we took with our milk as children not good?"</p>
<p>
"We will always take our milk," he said, "But the
world, I have learned, is larger than our childhood.  I will speak to
the travelers so that each one will follow me to the lake and learn
about us.  Then they will hear us sing and share our dancing.  This
way, we will be in their world too."</p>
<p>
"I
want to understand," she said.  "But I <I>am
</I> part of the world.  I have never doubted it."</p>
<p>
"There is no happiness like words and voices, good words, and no
joy like our music that becomes more than the argument of voices,
more than words.  We can share this music.  I want you to be more
than you have been, to be as much as you can be.  As for me,
Loiyangalani is my home, and I will remain, but I have learned from
the books that I am free, and no man's servant."  
</p>
<p>
"And what will you gain?" she asked.  
</p>
<p>
"A corrugated tin roof is a good thing," Francis said.  "I
will live under such a cover some day, with cement and metal and a
headrest of feathers.  I will speak with pride.  No one will beat me
or demand my service."</p>
<p>
 In her childhood freedom Nalantei had learned that a beating, or any
force applied to her body was a momentary outrage, and would be
quickly forgotten, and if she did not fully understand, she did not
care, as with age her freedom  grew.  From her mother she had learned
that women may live or may endure, but as the devout and tender mate
of Francis she believed that her life, supported like the sail of a
fishing boat or the weaver bird's nest, might never fall, and
she might always live her story, her self-sung flight. 
</p>
<p>

It was a story, her life, related alone and to herself, expressed as
a song to an absent friend or a growing child, whose dark eyes, wide
in wonder, would attend and rejoice in it.  It was the present and,
in her longing, the future in exaltation.  She had sung as an infant
with few words, intoning fragments of a tune which were threaded and
pieced like beads into a longer segment which in time had lost its
first purpose and became something wholly new and her own.  At rest
her song reviewed the day through lips pursed and covered against her
mother's sight, the rise and fall of pitch, more the suggestion
of a little pressure of her lips or of consciousness than actual
expression.  This voice was secure even as she grew, but as the song
began to recede in outward expression, the voice remained, and the
story endured as a counting and recounting in unrelenting
hopefulness.  It was <I>her</I> story,
unique among songs and among lives, and carried the world in its
strophic embrace.</p>
