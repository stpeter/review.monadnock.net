<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 9 of 16)</h5>
<p>"Nalantei, rise from your couch and betray no insolence.  I see that you are well enough."  Lekapana propels a cheekful of tobacco toward the ashes, lowering his lips in the strained smile of a serpent, the spittle emerging like a dark tongue between the gap in his lower teeth.  Sienti, who has also taken tobacco, spits moments later in answer.   Lekapana continues, "Did you know that as you slept this past night Sopoitan was near, that he too is in our debt, and we as wife-givers shall be bound to him and the Lngwesi in a greater peace and understanding?"</p>
<p>
"I know that this nkang will receive stock and may ask always
for support from them, but last night I slept little and knew only
the sound of the hyena and the anxious cow, the footsteps and the
anger . . ."</p>
<p>
"The man Sopoitan and his friend Lekiso waited for the morning. 
There was no anger.  Do you understand that there is no anger and no
curse?  Why do you speak of anger?  In marriage you will find a new
life, and children.  Do you think of children, Nalantei?"     
</p>
<p>
"There was a rag I held long ago which my mother sewed from
cloth and soft goat skin and filled with grass and scented flowers
and dust.  It was thin like me with black eyes of stone that wandered
on its head and it was white like a new child.  I knew it was a boy
child because of the skins that he wore.  He did not shiver in the
morning's coolness but when my mother left me for the cows, I
held my rag friend to keep him warm and I believed that his warmth
was because I held him; his belly and legs were thin, so I collected
more grass and stuffed him with it so he would grow; in this way each
day I would feed him like a child.  The grass would dry each day and
he was thin again, but growing; but he was stolen from me so long ago
and must have died as children sometimes do.   He was taken from me
and he died, though he was only a rag of dust and grass."   
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, do you know the elders who sit with you?  Do you know
that we speak to you with our love, as a woman of our clan?  We have
watched you grow.  We see you now not only as a daughter but as the
future of all Samburu, as a mother in Nkanyit.   Do you understand? 
Do you see this love? 
</p>
<p>
It
is a curious love, she knows, directed to one already removed
spiritually and remembered, in varying tones of sullen contempt and
floating praise, flowing over her body like a sand river that flows
only in the wind before the torrent return, or floating like a
dream &#151; she a spirit or perhaps a paralyzed body hearing as in
death with no power to strike, to defend, to speak; she herself
doubting that there may be substance remaining to love.  And yet the
love of which they speak grows in meaning, a love that they say
exists for her, that she might grasp, not for those that speak, not
for duty or Nkanyit.  But in a moment of clarity she sees that this
love is the net that holds, the blunt arrow that will not pierce, a
love that is <I>for</I> her only in that
she is its prize.  Lekapana sees the quick wry smile, delicate as a
feather, that floats across her face &#151; more in her eyes than in
any motion of her lips &#151; and passes in flight.  
</p>
<p>
 Soft footsteps, lunar meanderings, the eager cow, approaching song,
such purification, such cleansing, the fallen warriors, unspoken
words, are finished and away; yet impossible tears from heavy-laden
eyes cannot be pried, by a name, taken without remorse, a name that
was so loved; that word: the insult of a question, that slap of abuse
which smothers respite, anyone, anything but the word, the name,
which, in a drop of blood is mingled, to be anyone but . . .
"Nalantei," who when prostrate must leap, who, in the jaws
of predation &#151; teeth dulled with formal justification, with
menacing breath the strike withheld, and with the sheathed claws of
love &#151; must assent, only "Nalantei" . . .</p>
<p>
Within the hut there is little air as the palm leaves were woven as
tightly as Sienti's strong hands would allow, and that air is
still and lifeless like a smoky broth but for a shuffling body whose
motion may stir a tepid breeze.  It is enough because it is her
mother's fire which smokes at just this hour as it did when she
was a child, when this fire, this smoke, was the nurturing beckoning
constant as she walked alone, as soon as she could walk, to the shore
and stood, squint-eyed at the blinding waters of evening, and wider
eyed at the Lmolo fishermen; she walked alone, staring in
child-wonder at the Turkana women who ignored her or frowned as they
would to a wayward goat . . . dark women sturdily unwavering in their
so severe path, darker skins covering their own, (taken from the same
goats, now silenced) Turkana women with their tight-bound tufts of
hair like the mounds of thirsting grass; alone again, the refracted
light from a fishing boat's patched sails &#151; almost like a
spider web winded out to sea, pointing heavenward as if suspended
just above water by an invisible filament, a tether from the sky &#151; and
kneeling by the shore at a small pool to cup with her hands a drink
of the salt-mild water; then, sure of the way and the hour, running,
thin legs carrying her bounding lightly over mounds of shore grass
rising stiff and yellow in dryness, by skittish donkeys tearing at
the mounds and noisy in their surprise, flying past curious pits and
burrows, ["Nalantei"] leaping like a young gazelle in the
sure pleasure of leaping, toward the embers and the smoke and evening
milk from a living goat, to Sienti's greeting without focus or
question ["Nalantei"] before she turned to her corner and
the mat of silent goat, returning in memory to the silver shimmer of
the lake, before the blast of sun-driven night.</p>
<p>
<I>Whose voice is that I hear, is someone calling?</I></p>
<p>
"Nalantei, there is no other time.  Nalantei!  Look at me
daughter.  Do you feel the fire?"  Lekapana rises uncoiled to
the pink smoking embers, adding a few small sticks and one larger
piece of dry wood to replenish the flame.  "You will have
children, Nalantei, and they will be more than grass and flowers, but
of dust they will be brothers as are all Samburu. The seketet seed
will protect you, and your children will comfort you and grow, not
from dry grasses but in the warmth of milk and sunlight.  Do you know
this?"</p>
<p>"How can I know when I may not hope?" She remains sitting upright, her eyes fixed upon the awakening blaze in the comfort of warmth and color, and the full building wind currents which drive and release in short eddies, and drive again, stronger still.</p>
<p>
The men sit, clouded in expression, almost inert like a tragedy's
chorus, and chant in remonstrance.  They all know this noise of a
fire's spurts and pops against the whistling insistence of
night.  To every child of Kulal the rise and push borne in the
shadows is the necessary release and engendering of sleep.  When in
daylight there is the rare cover of clouds, the engine of night will
not be turned; that which remains, the mere murmur in desultory air,
brings only oppressive warmth, and in the stillness, the mosquitoes'
scream to hours of embattlement.  Better this, the desiccating flutes
of night, whose insistent peal is a mother's song.  Lekapana
stands again before Nalantei:</p>
<p>
"Would you cause your husband to beat you in anger?  Would you
bring a curse on yourself and your clan, or your children?"</p>
<p>
"Why
do <I>you </I>speak of anger and the
curse?"</p>
<p>
Nalantei's eyelids fall as though drawn down her face, and the
creatures of the flame retreat.  Francis sits by her (his presence
less a dream than an evocation) and laughs as the brilliant light of
night and the perfect peace of the wind's dry storm beckon her
like the loved sounds of Perean, her father, in sleep or just
before &#151; the weight and release, the gusts that Sienti held
closely in convulsions that the child knew but did not understand,
and the girl remembered from so long ago &#151; and she hears her
warrior laugh again in the ragged night, a boy, awkward in his
motions, his thin legs and wide feet unsettled, lifting himself for a
moment to let her breathe, having withdrawn in spasm, his fluid in a
thread trail upon her leg and stomach, then collapsing heavily again,
(the wind's laughter too, in heavy breath of passion spent); and
abating with the wind, he kneels beside her as his hands hide his
erect nakedness, and she laughs too that it was all so much more than
her private story had foretold, more joyful still than her song's
anticipation.  Alone, behind her eyelids' weight, beyond the
present wind and fire &#151; because it was all possible, despite the
memory of the women's songs in caustic emptiness and the men's
blessing of joy's denial &#151; she laughs.  
</p>
<p>
The elders see her face in flickering light in the silent grimace of
laughter, and cannot understand.  Lekiso, Sopoitan's second,
spits into the fire.  The tobacco is good, he says, better than the
overly dry cakes brought to them sometimes by traders visiting the
settlement near Kulal.  The Somalis in Loiyangalani know tobacco, he
says.  They all nod approval, and glance curiously once more at
Nalantei, whose head turns in the warmth of her smile.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
For Nalantei there remains the song of a warrior who stood before her
without shame or fear; their binding, the physical form of
wonderment.  Before the rarefied red of the fire light she hears
again in her near dream the approach of Francis and his muran friend,
Kimiti, the night before, when she rose to the stars a second time to
receive her mother's blessing:  
</p>
<p>
Kimiti lifted his spears from their upright position in the ground,
their points bared, and carried them some paces away.  He jammed both
spears into the barren earth, the tips pointing upward as a warning
and, turning toward Kulal, (which was evident only as a demarcation
of starlessness before the faintest glow of morning light) stared
into that silent void, agitated and cautious in his guard, but
sensitive to the moment.  Ignoring Sienti, he said, "Here is the
required gift of fat and ochre which Francis Lesanta gives to you but
not to the elder, Sopoitan, who will not care.  The muran of our clan
will come to support you, but do not look for Francis or me.  Francis
will not be part of this.  He will follow no other ceremony or rite
and will not touch Nalantei again."  In this action, and in the
words of his friend, Francis had fulfilled what was expected of him,
even as he abhorred the custom and the form.  Nalantei glanced at him
only momentarily and returned to face Francis.  Sienti walked away to
her milking, knowing that Nalantei must follow shortly to fulfill
their final ritual together.  Nalantei found Francis in a suspension
of painted passions, unreadable and silent, a shared tragedy which
both might wish to deny in its immediacy, but could not deny in the
colors of ritual, in the late moon-turning helplessness of the
absolute present.  She watched him in the intensity of his focus,
knowing that this vision's solemn twisting hope-lost memory was
necessary, vital.  She thought his eyes and skin deepened in color,
intensified, as he perceived her thoughts which must be his own.  She
observed, smiling weakly to him, and looked for the reflection of her
smile.  Waiting, she saw no reflection, and the eyes she knew no
longer knew her but seemed drawn to an empty distant vision within
him.  His spears, which he had held upright before her, were lowering
by slow degrees, no longer held together securely in his left hand. 
One spear fell to the ground on his left side, and as a faint fear
mounted in her she looked at Francis again to see eyes that were
beginning to pulse in a tight wobble, without focus. She heard
herself gasp and step back, turning, as the second spear fell toward
her and its long shaft glanced off her back, falling harmlessly as
she leaned away.  The quivering passed from his eyes to his legs and
arms, steadily inward, and in moments was released throughout his
slender fine-boned body like a cold shiver.  She knew he did not see
her now, or anything, nor would he remember these passing moments. 
Kimiti, responding finally to the soft sounds of fallen spears, ran
immediately to restrain his friend.  Francis fell stiffly to the
ground, but Nalantei, in a rush of fear did not move to him, but saw
Kimiti kneel quickly and hold Francis by the shoulders and lift his
back, as she observed his body, totally convulsed and shaking, his
head gyrating quickly and jerking suddenly like a flutter of wings. 
He shook more violently as Kimiti loosed his grip, and she saw Kimiti
fall himself, nearly helpless by Francis.  There was little noise as
she watched them in awe and sorrow, their bodies so oddly bent on
their sides, moving more like speared fish than birds, or men. 
Nalantei knew the ndokuna of a warrior to whom custom denied a
battle, its release to a diminished consciousness: an expression of
anger or any intense feeling that no chosen action could assuage. 
She felt herself shiver as she sank down, still aware, still watching
consciously as the two young men began to recover, shivering, staring
into darkness, yet returning to the world and to her.  Kimiti lifted
a hand to his brow which was moist with blood &#151; Francis had reared
upward in a spasm, and their heads had collided, more to Kimiti's
disadvantage.  They soon stood once more, spears in readiness, solemn
and reserved as Nalantei returned to her mother's hut.  The
young men appeared as strong and steady as they had minutes before. 
All this was accepted, borne without shame, already a passing memory
as their bodies were their own again.  Francis must dissolve his
bond, striding steadily away as Nalantei watched, his self-conscious
steps a progress toward his ostensible home, the bush, the vast land
which had never been so empty for him, knowing that he must finally
return to the faceless settlement to be the tourist's friend,
the aid to the mission, being not fully Samburu or city man.  He had
come to fight for her, but a stand lost in high light to silence or
to jeering laughter was a disgrace he must not endure.  Nalantei
observed his retreat &#151; the uneven gait she knew so well, his hands
squeezing the air as he strode &#151; noting that he never turned to
look back.</p>
