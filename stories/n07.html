<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h5>(Page 7 of 16)</h5>
<p>Beyond the man-dense, life-packed smaller sphere of the hut she hears the muran singing again, renewed like the hearth, competing with the wind, distant, indistinct in the evening's depths.  Another figure, obscured by the fire, enters silently and assumes a seat. But Lekapana will not loose her now.  "Do you know the songs, Nalantei?"</p>
<p>
"Nalantei," she said, speaking her own name softly.      
</p>
<p>
"Do you hear me, daughter?"</p>
<p>
"Yes." 
</p>
<p>
"The Sesei and the other private ones, the children's songs
which grew among the muran and girls, words whispered among you, your
secret words and your secret songs.  Do you hear them now?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."  Lekapana, startled by her answer, demands,</p>
<p>
"What do you say?"</p>
<p>
"I thought I heard them."</p>
<p>
"What is she saying?" he calls to the others attending . 
"Is this a riddle or does she mock us? . . .   There is no child
song, Nalantei. . .  Do you hear her?  She thinks that the muran and
the girls call to her.  Are there yet such words?"  No one
speaks.  Lekapana, weakened by his confusion, sees that Nalantei will
not help him.  "What are the muran?" he asks her
imperiously.  His voice is harsh and old:  "They are small fish
that founder in the shallows, knowing no place and no home. They
fight each other because they have no other battle, no one to defend.
 They paint themselves and walk into the bush and plot.  Some attend
their cattle with little fervor, but would steal the cattle of
others. They speak to the women with new words, to deceive the
elders.  They would be lovers, but seduce our wives.  They are
without Nkanyit and possess little and may not marry.  What was your
lover?"</p>
<p>
"He was kind."</p>
<p>
"Oh yes, he was kind.  He who has nothing may be kind, but
cannot be generous, cannot be worthy.  A boy with no responsibility
may seek you for his pleasure and weigh down your neck with his
beads, but what are his promises?  He is of our clan, and therefore
your brother.  You know this.  He praises you but will deceive you,
and his loyalty has a foundation of sand, to collapse and scatter
before the winds.  His praise and promises are like raindrops on the
lake as your tears fall upon dry earth.  The elders know these muran.
 They are as unruly and wrathful as hungry dogs.  You must avoid them
always.  You must neither seek their company nor allow their praise
or their touch, as you are Ngaibartani and the wife of a worthy man. 
Do you understand my words?"</p>
<p>
"I understand." 
</p>
<p>
"Now I ask you again, do you hear the children's songs?"</p>
<p>
"The muran?"</p>
<p>
"Do you hear them, Nalantei?"</p>
<p>
"I might hear them."</p>
<p>
"But do you hear them plot?"</p>
<p>
"No."</p>
<p>
"Only a dance, only the taunts of children?"  No answer. 
"Tell us truly, as you are not among children but are now a
wife."  Silence.  "Speak now."</p>
<p>
"I will not listen to them."</p>
<p>
"These words, Nalantei, these songs of the muran are the games
of youth.  Do you laugh with us at the songs of children?"</p>
<p>
"I laugh."  
</p>
<p>
For a few moments Lekapana rests, and the whole party in attendance
waits for him, each one caught in the necessary consequence of this
exchange, recalling or suppressing the sentiments to which no one
among them would give voice.  And still the muran sing, as if in
mockery, and the drum of their footfalls resounds in the rising night
air to the elders . . . and to their wives.</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, your body is smooth and pure and blessed.  Your
mother has cleansed you and Sopoitan, your husband, has given your
father a fine heifer in calf.  Do you know this?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, I know it."</p>
<p>
"And this morning you rested your head upon your mother's
back while she milked her cow as when you were an infant.  Is this
true?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"You are Ngaibartani.  Remember that your mother fed you and
nursed you when you were very young.  She taught you as a mother must
and you grew strong and willful.  She taught you duty and she gave
you freedom.  She has fulfilled her duty and our customs and will no
longer give you milk from her cow.  With Sopoitan you will be like
your mother and bear children and give them your milk as you will
have given them your blood and that of Sopoitan.  This is your honor
and your duty and the gift of your womanhood.  Do you know this?"
 No answer.  "Nalantei, do you understand what I say?"</p>
<p>
"Sir?"</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, this is your life, do you know what this means?"
 Silence.  Do you know what you have become, do you know what you
are?"</p>
<p>
"I am a cow."  Lekapana rises angrily, gesturing,</p>
<p>"I think she will dishonor us, and that we will find her among us again before the rains . . . yes, before the rains, whenever that may be, whenever that must surely be.</p>
<p>"I will not take her back into my home, honored sir," Sienti says, looking toward Sopoitan, "even if you should beat her without mercy.  She is strong and clean and must learn respect."  Another man, the silent stranger, raises his head.  Near him is his own walking staff, which out of habit he lifts as he speaks:</p>
<p>"But your home is mine, wife.  With what spear will you block the way?  Have you a fine legion of secret women to whip me from my path should my daughter and I come to this door?  On the eve of Nalantei's new life I will not have you deny her past, her heritage, or her future.  She is to become Lngwesi.  For what wrong do you cast her away as if to serve as carrion to a jackal?  She will be remembered as my daughter, if not yours.  This worthy man, Sopoitan, will give her wealth and children and will beat her less than I in my deference permitted you.  Because her mind and stomach are strong and she has a tender heart she will one day bring honor to us.  I know also that she must be a stranger to me and I do not rejoice in it."  Squatting by the still weakening fire on his lorika, Perean had looked much like a Laibon in a trance, focused on the fading pink embers, his head unbowed for more than an hour.  He had remained silent before the conquest of Nalantei's spirit such that he had been nearly forgotten, the respect for his father-love discounted by his statuesque silence.  He relaxes his grasp, but does not replace the walking stick by the wall, but after a few moments he tightens his grip and speaks again:</p>
<p>"I heard the Muran last evening as I slept.  It was wrong that they sang  as they did, as Sopoitan is a worthy elder.  They do not know him or they would not show such disrespect. And as I woke I knew the clear and ugly words of the women as they blessed Nalantei; I heard the songs of the women and the celebration of the muran, though I did not turn my ear, and heard no secret songs, no private words.  The Sesei and Nshupa are as in our youth, but mutable, and there are soft responses that shift as before and we have chosen not to deny them.  Surely they too have new words as we once had."</p>
<p>Her father's voice is a part of her voice and the source of her songs, those of her childhood, so distant, recalled as a protected mystery.  She hears the patter, the rising and the lowering, the soft intoning of his Maa, in her confinement, as behind the approaching howl of deepening night.  There is Perean's face in the fire and the new smoke, and beyond the sacramental flame she sees the face of her mother, but through this veil Sienti is youthful again, the woman who attended the same voice of her father in so many past years, yet with eyes so clear, hair black and shining, her skin as smooth as the water-washed stone, her breasts large in proffered fullness, with words in lightness and tenderness construed, as Perean came to her to sing. . .</p>
<p>Sopoitan is silent, and Lekapana, shifting his weight nervously, and determined to retain his place as inquisitor elder, speaks:</p>
<p>"I see, my friend Perean, that your heart is still strong, like one that must have grown within the girl.  We must concede your wisdom and ask the blessing of Ngai that she may honor us as you do."  Finally there is peace without words as the assembly, with the exception of Nalantei, finds some minutes peace in the fire and the wind.</p>
<p>For Nalantei the silence is not of intensity of feeling &#151; of Sienti's anger in her rebuff or the others who have no experience of such a father's defense, and in whom the silent mocking insinuation of an impurity in devotion resurfaces to question the motivation of an open defense by this man, as if in a conference of elders, stick in hand, to command attention, speaking of heritage, of denial, and with passion though without the syllable  "love" &#151; her silence was not of affect, but of a captive who, in furtive silence hears herself described and evaluated, and rather than confront the words, maintains silence without the will to resist or defend. She knows his voice and her name upon it and only perceives that her father is newly himself in his exercised temperament, and that she is defended, but also that she is relinquished, and even as she lies near them (propped slightly on a samburr bag stuffed with a lambskin) she is spoken of by the elders as a foreign entity, one already removed spiritually and remembered, in varying tones of sullen contempt and floating praise.</p>
<p>She can still hear them, the elders, their questions and entreaties like the passing variations in a warrior's song, or as the prescribed responses in the Mass; voices in a half circle emerge in the murmur of sleep song, words, articulate but meaningless before a name that grips her almost as her own, emerging like a weaver chick plucked from the enclosure, the circle of Maa, the child-smooth tongue of her first songs; his name flies out, and she chokes as she emerges in her color, bound as by a vine called Nkanyit, drawn against the clutching tendrils in her own broken flight.</p>
<p>"But the ochre and fat and tobacco were given by Kimiti, not the one called Francis, Lesanta's son.  Is this not an impertinence?  The boy is not a true muran.  He has not merely lost his way among us, he has abandoned it.  I see him among the wazungu visitors, but his dance has no form, it is only words.  He gives them back their words and becomes their donkey."</p>
<p>Perean lifts his walking stick again as if at council, and seeing himself in this action, a habitual formality with no present purpose, he laughs and replaces the stick by his side. Nalantei sees that his head still shines from the butter that was rubbed there that afternoon as the ox was killed, and the copper earrings and pale blue beads remain as ceremony requires.</p>
<p>"Do we not dance if they pay us?  Indeed I fear that we would forget our old songs were we not enticed by the wealthy English and Americans.  This is still our world, our land, but if we are hungry we may dance."  There is silence as they listen to Perean.  He passes some shredded miraa and a small bag of tobacco among them, (a responsibility which he had almost forgotten).  "I will speak for the boy, Lesanta, who is called Francis, so that you and our daughter will understand."</p>
<p>"Speak for him?"</p>
<p>"Yes, for him, who is not among us, and who indeed has no place here but in our words."  He does not look at his daughter, but again his hand moves toward his stick.  "His birth infirmity is not his creation but that of Ngai, who makes as a gift to us all some impairment, either of body or place or spirit, to challenge us.  Surely a debility in reasoning, in choice, (by nature or time, a foolishness of mind) is no less an impediment than a weak limb or a broken voice. Perhaps it is a gift to have the legacy of a delimited range of choice, to clarify action.  There is no virtue in infirmity, but there is virtue in the choosing to live well, in whatever form.  Lesanta's son has strength of mind and courage, and for what he lacks in beauty as a muran and covers with village cloth, he compensates for with his wits.  He knows as well as any Samburu the plants and roots, and better than most our historical past and the variations of our clans throughout the lands and mountains of Ngai.  And how many walk so freely among the Turkana as among the Rendille and Lmolo?  In his speech he has the words and the taste of the Turkana as of a childhood tongue, so much so that but for his features he might pass as Turkana among them."  In a motion toward Nalantei he continues, "To our daughter he was loyal beyond mere custom, and for a time she walked not so much alone because of his attentions.  And a young girl such as she &#151; as uncontrollable by her mother as a growing calf and, like a calf, innocent of the wider world which provides little nurture without knowledge and may even be an indifferent predator &#151; a child enthralled in the growing expectations of her womanhood, will seek a guide and protector.  She thrived by Lesanta in her girl's time, and was kept safely."</p>
<p>There is more of flesh that quivers and bleeds because of the knife, torn and taken.  So long ago she watched him, and believed the boy, Lesanta, Francis, was not afraid as he lived the knife of life, of death:</p>
<p>Lekapana had come to awaken her with his weighty voice before the sun rose over Kulal.  She followed him, rubbing her eyes.  Three goats lay upon the matted earth.  First she saw the blood which flowed slowly from their necks.  One man stood with a deep nkarau of the Rendille style and with a paddle was stirring intently and vigorously.  He spattered a small amount of the blood on his red and yellow cloth cloak and grumbled discontent as he tried to wipe it away.  The goats were quiet in dying &#151; who, only moments before, would have run frantically and been halted by the ropes, or made a weak charge amid the laughter of the men who held them by the horns as they pulled and pushed.  Their slit goat eyes, (like a cat's, she thought) were quiet, and two of the goats seemed to run while on their sides, the subdued motion of their hooves, futile and sad as they plied the air, finding no resistance of earth beneath them.  The men laughed and talked as they worked, joking and teasing, their jesting directed at times to a boy who laughed with them but stood some distance away watching, just as she watched.  Nalantei could feel Lekapana's eyes on her as she observed the rites of men, of elders.  There was a shallow furrow sunk into the hardened earth which sloped slightly to allow blood and other material to be washed away.  Five poles supported a thatched palm roof above one pole on each of four corners and a higher center pole.  There were no walls and an easy breeze flowed in the artificial shade.  Even before all motion ceased each goat was flayed by one man in his own style, beginning at the neck, cutting through the belly to the groin.  The skin was pushed and plied away with an occasional knife cut to loosen the sinew.  The goat odor was pleasant and fresh and the fat nearly white.  The boy spoke to one man who cut a small ball of fat from his goat and gave it to him.  He smiled in thanks.  They had spoken in Turkana, but Nalantei knew that the boy was Samburu.  She had seen him walking, like herself, by the shore, though his gait, quick  and uneven, was one of preoccupation and direction more than contemplation.  She thought that he must be one of the older boys at the mission school where she had just entered, he, dressed so differently, and with such confidence, obviously comfortable among the men though they teased him incessantly.  The boy rubbed the fat into his lorika, which made it shine.  There was the residue of ocher where his head would be positioned, but she knew the lorika must be a gift from an elder because he was not a muran, for he wore the blackened skins of a boy, with only a small round patch of hair left unshaven on the top of his head.  But his bearing reflected the confidence and quality of a warrior despite an unevenness of his step. The Ilmugit ceremony of muranhood would occur in the next month, and he was preparing as an initiate. She knew that he recognized her too, but they did not speak that day among the elders.  He was of the Lmasula clan, like herself, but from a smaller settlement closer to the lake, west of the town of Loiyangalani. She watched as the men wielded large knives which sunk deep into the necks of each goat, separating the goat heads from their bodies, and watched as a large piece of goat flesh, taken from the leg, was placed on a railing; she watched as it quivered, as if to run again, though torn and taken, flesh alienated from bone, from goat-mind; and the men laughed as they hung the carcasses on hooks from the center pole, pleased that there was meat, that their families might not be hungry &#151; meat to sell to the Somali shopkeepers for shillings to buy tobacco.</p>
