<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>
<!--
<h5>(Page 10 of 16)</h5>
<p>
A large iron pot rests obliquely on the fire; this fire which
dances &#151; in daubed red, yellow and white, reaching broadly with
varying fingers &#151; has focused intensity to its core so that the
air is seen to flow like sediment through calm water, in suspended
meandering currents.  Faces in this sole illumination flow and writhe
as red eyes advance and retreat, long bodies rise too and recoil,
pallid and distant.  Nalantei sees them but does not know the strange
eyes about her that do not express or affect, serpent eyes, fateful
and menacing in deep night's gale.  There is no longer sleep as
her heart's storm is similarly wrought.  The elders understand
now that she hears only inflection, not words; they know that they
have broken the inner circle of her protected world, and that like a
gazelle, stunned in capture, she will no longer resist or attempt to
flee; she must submit until that release which is no longer freedom.</p>
<p>
The specter of a man is elevated again; the firelight, resolved to
glowing charcoal, presents the face of a demon, and the chorus too,
each apparition rising in turn, has found her once more.  They are
summoned.  The heat of the fire and the burn of deathly red eyes upon
her has become an unreality to watch from without.  She would die
now, she thinks; reduced at the hot charcoal; she would melt to feed
the heat and turn to ash which does not fear a flame or the eyes of a
serpent spirit.  One among them, who might have been Lekapana in
another world, points to another more forbidding incubus, and with
raised voice like the sting of falling hot ash, calls to her:</p>
<p>
"Look at this man,  Nalantei.  Do you know him?"  At first
she does not speak, but as the phantom Lekapana approaches her she
chokes with the words,</p>
<p>
"I know no one."</p>
<p>
"Look, Nalantei, who is he?"  Silence.  "This man is
Sopoitan, who has killed the marriage ox and has come for you.  Who
is he?"  The chorus of spirits intones, voices both compounded
and several:  "Speak."   "Say his name."</p>
<p>
"Sopoitan."   She answers by rote, the questions having no
meaning but sound.</p>
<p>
"Who is he, child?"  Silence.  "What is he to you?"
 Silence.  "Say he is your husband."</p>
<p>
"Your
husband."  Chorus:  "Say &#145;<I>my</I>
 husband'."</p>
<p>
"My husband."</p>
<p>
"Do you know that he is a worthy man?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Will you respect him and the first wife, Naperu?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"If you bring peace to his home and clan, all will honor you."</p>
<p>
"Yes." 
</p>
<p>
"If you are a good guardian to your cattle, the pest will not
afflict them."</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Your cattle and your children will sustain you, as you sustain
them."</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, our child, will you forget the lessons, the truth of
Nkanyit?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."  The chorus of elders shouts, "say &#145;no'."</p>
<p>
"No." 
</p>
<p>
"You must be a loyal wife, that your children will not die."
 She does not speak.  The elders call again, "say &#145;yes'."</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Sopoitan will protect you from the young ones, the foolish and
dangerous muran who would offend and disgrace you. . .  Do you hear?"</p>
<p>
"Yes." 
</p>
<p>
 "As you will be among the Lngwesi, the certainty of Nkanyit
will guide you.  This world in Nkanyit, you will not forget."</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"If this is your life, you need never fear the whip.  If this is
your life then you need never fear the curse. . .  Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Listen to me, Nalantei . . ." 
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei," she says, repeating his invocation, hearing
only her name.  Lekapana turns abruptly,</p>
<p>
"What?"  Chorus: "Listen!"</p>
<p>
"Listen," she repeats.</p>
<p>
"Yes, you must understand.  You are a woman of some few years
and a wife.  A boy learns Nkanyit as a muran; he stands with his
age-mates and lives by the land and must leave his mother and her
milk as Ngai has directed."  (Chorus, severally: "Ngai.")
 A boy must learn Nkanyit and become worthy.  A girl must respect her
husband's worthiness and enhance his honor among the elders,
preserve the cattle he gives her and protect them for her sons, as
Ngai directs."  Chorus: "Ngai."  Nalantei answers,
"Ngai."</p>
<p>
"Yes, but will you be a wife to Sopoitan who will know her duty
and find her happiness?"</p>
<p>
"Happiness."  Chorus: "Say &#145;yes'."  She
cannot speak.  Again the fire-lit apparitions seem to hiss as their
spit projects into the flames and they call to her: 
</p>
<p>
"Speak, say &#145;yes'."</p>
<p>
"Happiness."  There is impatient grumbling as they chide
her again: "Say &#145;yes'."</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, do not listen to the voices; you must never allow the
secret voices; you must never allow the dark voices that call in the
night." 
</p>
<p>
 The chorus of elders watches her.  Sienti is silent.  Lekapana leaps
upward, "Nalantei, will you love your husband and find your
place among the Lngwesi clan?"</p>
<p>
"Love," she says, choking.  Chorus, loudly:  "Say
&#145;yes'."    
</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Can there be a better man for you than Sopoitan?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."  Chorus, angrily:  "Say &#145;no'."</p>
<p>
"No."</p>
<p>
"Do you see that you must no longer walk alone?"  Silence. 
"You must walk with the women of the Lngwesi. . .  Do you see?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Can there be a greater love than we show you?"  Silence. 
"Nkanyit is love, do you see?  Ngai is love, do you see?" 
The spirit chorus is exercised in her profound silence, some say,
"Ngai," others bid her respond, "Yes," arms
waving behind the fire, but she does not see men or know their
voices. 
</p>
<p>
Though Lekapana approaches to stand by Nalantei, she can only stare
at the fire, and discerns only an animate presence.  As his hand
touches her head, the warm paw expresses no sharpness or anger, and
produces no gash, as she will not flee him, or arouse an unsheathing
in his clutch.</p>
<p>
Her eyelids press together until the fire light filters through in
red &#151; like the red of her warrior's ochered neck in moonlit
night, his eyes unperceiving, helpless, a warrior's scarlet,
like a Turkana sunset, or her own matted blood &#151; for the boy,
Francis, to whom she could only send her love as a furtive prayer,
quieter, more distant than the strangeness of Jesus, as insubstantial
as a wafer of God.</p>
<p>
"We will bless you now," Lekapana says, "Do not forget
these words and do not turn from this blessing and earn our curse."
 The elders' voices are calmed, merely attendant murmurs without
admonishment before her silence.  
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, what is a flower?" 
</p>
<p>
She perceives him now, but will the demon bless her?  For there is no
sense, no feeling. 
</p>
<p>
"Nalantei, what is a flower?"  Lekapana sees that even as
he speaks, her eyes are drained such that her body is mere energy
without thought, energy seeping away like blood from a wound; he sees
that even as he has served her, served Nkanyit, he is as a predator
who loves his prey for the sustenance, the life that is given, but
further, she is his cub, to be driven to her own future, to thrive as
she may in a new savannah.  The chorus is waiting.</p>
<p>
"It is enough," he says.  "It is finished."</p>
<p>
An nkarau of cool milk diluted with water is brought forward as
Nalantei gazes without focus into the fire.  It is the same milk that
her mother sprinkled on her many hours before as a symbolic cleansing
and purification, before the knife.  Each elder dips a hand into the
liquid and, like a sudden strike, each one in turn sheds the liquid
upon Nalantei, some from her side, others through the fire, the cool
moisture hitting her face abruptly, like a hundred stings and the
slap of many hands, each elder intoning his favorite chant in
blessing, to which the chorus answers:  "Ngai."  
</p>
<p>
As the blessing begins she hears a scream in the sudden resurrection
of her mind, the shock of her body, and is brought to consciousness
enough to recognize that it is her own voice &#151; first distant in
the hissing torment, rising as a song begun, and then forsaken; her
breath lifts as one drowning, gasping in the fire-illuminated ether;
she sees herself in moments as if observed from without, as the
frailty of her body, the insubstantial yet indomitable flesh, is
bound among adamant spirits.</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai bless you."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai grant you health."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai give you the peace of still water."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai give you songs."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai protect you in your journey."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May green grass grow where you walk."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai give you sons."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May your laughter flow like honey."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May you live in peace with your husband."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May you live in harmony with your family."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May your cattle and goats thrive."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May your days pass in quiet hours and simplicity." 
"Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May you live to old age."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May your sons care for you in your last days."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai bless you always."  "Ngai."</p>
<p>
 "May Ngai bless you."  "Ngai.". . .  
</p>
<p>
Beyond the sting of milk that would not nourish, beneath their breath
and the sputtering fire &#151; like a chasm into which she falls, to be
embedded in the earth's airless core from which she might yet
grasp for the filament of her redemption, grasp even the sordid
darkened word of love &#151; the scream has ended, the song has ended .
. .  There is no voice.
