<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<h4>Part II - Whispers in Laughter  (October)</h4>
<h5>(Page 11 of 16)</h5>
<p>
In a land of unfamiliar footsteps, Nalantei spoke to her new sister,
Naperu, the first wife of her husband, and rejoiced in her kindness. 
The shape of the older woman's hut was familiar too, made so by
the common accouterments of a woman's home, much like Sienti's,
where the ornament of goat skins &#151; draped like a veil against the
rain, appearing merely dusty grey in idleness &#151; and the necessary
presentations and fortifications, the nkarau of new sweet goat milk,
a pot of fat, palm fiber baskets to be carried by donkeys or one of
the few camels in the settlement, a kudu horn and the sleeping mat,
were always prepared and ordered for the man, Sopoitan, who might
come to Naperu, the first, to lie with her. 
</p>
<p>
 The sky was clear as the women passed by like clouds, like a dream
until Nalantei spoke to them, their direction not hers until she
chose to detain them from their path.  Most of them, like herself,
were new to this settlement, not born Lngwesi, not born with Nkanyit
instilled so deeply, but married into custom, and conjoined. 
</p>
<p>
This was Nalantei's home and her land, the locus of her new
life, as she came to understand it must be. 
</p>
<p>
As Nalantei's gaze passed from the eyes of her friend, she who
would be her sister, the first wife of Sopoitan (though in age more
like a mother), she admired the tight weave of the new hut, the doum
palm not yet grey from time, dust or water's depredations, and
thought that she would soon begin to build her own home, perhaps near
to this hut which she had helped Naperu to build.  Hers would be on
the same plan, but in her own style.  And in the moon's second
fullness she would not reside with Naperu, or join her daughter,
Maluni &#151; who talked and laughed long into the night &#151; but as a
new wife, Nalantei would receive her husband, and the women would
accept her fully among them; she would have her indomitable place,
her own shield against the sun, the rain, and her man, Sopoitan, and
the other, Lekiso.</p>
<p>
Her sister's smile was on her again; it seemed somehow that
those eyes &#151; or was it the turn of her head and the movement of
her lips &#151; were old and familiar, though in gentleness, more
feminine than her mother, and though graceful, unlike her father's
generous furtive smile.  It seemed to her that she could no longer
remember exactly how her mother turned her head, or even if it was
her mother she was remembering.
