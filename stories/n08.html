<h3>The Assumption of Nalantei</h3>
<h4>by Stephen Marvin</h4>
<p>The early draft of this novella, formerly hosted at the Monadnock Review, is now being revised by the author for publication.</p>
<!--
<h5>(Page 8 of 16)</h5>
<p>
 Nalantei, alone among the elders and her mother, holds for herself
the animation of the fire before her, her head slowly moving left and
right, her lips parted as if to speak.  Though she has little
strength remaining, her will is not yet broken.  As the elders share
the tobacco and miraa that Perean left as a gift, they know that
Nalantei does not see them.  It is her choice.</p>
<p>
The night has turned, and the winds are rising.  She may not sleep. 
Lekapana speaks:</p>
<p>
"Sopoitan is a respected elder of the Lngwesi.  His son is
Launoni, leader of the muran.  Do you know this?"  She does not
answer.  "Nalantei, the first wife, Naperu,  also has a twelve
year old daughter whose name is Maluni.  Maluni waits to greet you
like any child who loves her mother's sister.  You will be
Naperu's sister and in time almost a mother to Maluni, who even
now has gifts for you as her welcome.  It would be well for you to
take something for her, perhaps some beads, as she has not yet been
allowed to take a lover.  Will you respect Naperu, the first, as she
is due?"</p>
<p>
"As she is due."</p>
<p>
"Do you know that there are wives who leave their husbands?. . .
 Yes there are such wives, but they are fools because they must
return.  Have you heard of such wives?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."  Her voice is only a whisper.</p>
<p>
"But what has Ngai given us?"  No answer.  "Nalantei,
what does Ngai ask of us?"</p>
<p>
"Nkanyit."  The elders grumble approval.</p>
<p>
"Yes, of course.  If there is no respect then we are like snakes
on the earth and fish in the sea.  If there is no respect then our
lives are as the wandering of animals with no dignity and no
understanding.  A girl must have Nkanyit or she will be merely a seed
in the wind and she will know no home and her child will wither as in
drought.  There are wives who run from Nkanyit and seek their
mothers.  But they must return.  What must they do?"</p>
<p>
"Nkanyit," she repeats, woodenly.</p>
<p>
"Nalantei," Lekapana's voice rises in impatience.  "A
wife must respect her husband and stay with him.  She must live with
him and his clan, and become one with them."</p>
<p>
". . . with him."</p>
<p>
"Yes, and the elders will protect her.  Do you know that if you
have Nkanyit then the elders of the Lngwesi clan will all be your
guardians?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Do you know that they will protect you?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
" . . . that they will see that you are never hungry?"  
</p>
<p>
"Yes."  Her voice becomes weaker with each response.</p>
<p>
" . . . that your children will be Lngwesi and proud?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"You understand why you must never walk alone?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Do you truly know that all Samburu are the children of Ngai,
and that Nkanyit is the code and aim of all who are his children?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Nalantei,
do you understand that you must never invite those voices, the dark
voices calling you in the night?  You must allow no entreaty to tear
you from your home and your duty."  All are silent.  "If
you are true, you will thrive, if not, you <I>will</I>
be cursed, and death may be your reward."  She does not speak.  
</p>
<p>
					</p>
<p>
Nalantei knew the Samburu of the Lngwesi clan, Sopoitan's kin,
only some hours distance, nearer to Kulal.  They would visit
sometimes, stopping for water and some provisions.  Francis told her
that they are some six families only, and have no Turkana near, but
drive their herds in peace and in isolation, and being Lngwesi, are
more respectful and follow the old ways, do not eat fish, though they
do keep camels.  They have no mission or school, and therefore no
Mary and no Jesus, only a Laibon of their own clan, who is old. 
Francis said that these Lngwesi do not trust the priest, the doctor
at the mission of Loiyangalani.  Of course they do not trust one who
is not Samburu &#151; this white Laibon who would not father a child &#151; a
man with no curse and therefore no power, who carries no rungu or
knife and would not follow Nkanyit and Ngai, but smiles in weakness
among them.  Nor do they trust the women of the mission, childless
and impure, dressed all white and ashamed, not of the land, their
legs swollen from the mosquito, and yet these creatures of a distant
God walk among the Samburu, live among them without Nkanyit; they
would profane and not respect, and speak Maa only to buy allegiance
with grain.  He said the Lngwesi do not trust those who live among
the mission people and the numerous Turkana in Loiyangalani.  Of
course they cannot understand, he said.  They are Samburu and afraid,
because they fear that never again will new muran &#151; like himself,
bristling with the spirit of conquest &#151; see the desert, the plains
or the mountains in the solitude of possession; that the elders may
never again speak of Nkanyit without seeing in dread that in this
wide circling world their children and their wives that might have
lived, may die, for more reasons than there are stars; that from
fear, not even the fever wracked elders who melt like tallow in their
life's-end gasping will allow themselves to be taken to see the
white Laibon, whose sorcery they will not accept.  They are
helplessly aware that even the girls have learned to deny a father's
marriage choice, and while their fathers frown and their mothers beat
them, sometimes the women desert their husbands and clans to live in
Baragoi, Maralal or Wamba or even beyond the Laikipia plateau which
is not the land of the Samburu, and their children rise among the
beggars without cattle, where Nkanyit is dead . . . and it is
finished, all of it.  They fear that one day soon the slopes of
Ng'iro will hold no welcome, and that there will be no cattle
and no song of the muran.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 But Nalantei did not fear the white Laibon, the priest.  Before she
knew Francis, before the school, before she understood his words, the
"Father," the Bwana man had led her to his home at the
mission.  His hand was hot and soft as they walked through the flat
square doorway into his office that day &#151; when her mother was
taken by him, removed to his care, to his mercy.  Teresa stood by as
Nalantei waited for his words, in the emptiness of her fear, of
stories untold.  She believed that this was part of her shame, and
that of her mother.  It had happened before.  She held from long
before a memory of this change:  Nalantei knew her mother's form
and step, the curve behind her long neck, the stoop of her
labors &#151; bent to milking in the morning, and carrying wood on her
head for the fire &#151; but it had been so sudden; in only a few weeks
the lines of Sienti's cheekbones and the soft concavity beneath
her eyes and jaw filled, with a like puffiness in her arms as her
belly began to swell and she walked more deeply stooped.  Now again
her mother had swollen, and again she had left her hut to be captive
to this Laibon, who did not yet speak her words.  
</p>
<p>
"Your mother lost one child in her first year of marriage, and
two since your were born," he said, "and they were taken,
assumed into heaven."  The priest left Nalantei alone with
Teresa among the images on the white walls, small people and small
places like pictures in a book or in the still distance: strange
boats upon the sea, the dark peaks she knew from the distance grown
larger; oryx, topi, and gazelle walking by the shore and two
cheetahs, a mother and a cub, walking past little dark cabins in the
evening, and other shapes that had no meaning, great angled
structures that pierced the sky like mountains, but human made she
knew, the women beneath in mid stride, stuck, halted in their step,
covered and tied at the waist, the men's legs covered too as if
ashamed.  The priest returned and gave Nalantei water in an nkarau
that looked like water itself, clear and stiff like the captured
motion of the women on the wall.  The water, because it was colder
than the spring, surprised her, but it was clear and felt calming in
her throat and stomach.  She turned her head to watch him while she
drank, and he smiled to her.  As he spoke, Teresa reformed his words
to help her understand.</p>
<p>
"Not all children are ready for the world.  The child your
mother carried these last months was much like you were some years
ago," he said, "but a child who could not live.  It had
grown inside her and was whole but did not enter the world alive, but
died before birth and was assumed by God.  A child is part of the
mother," he said, "and because he is her child, Sienti
loves him as she loves you, Nalantei," he said.  Because of how
the baby died, Sienti's body is hurt, but he, the Father and
Laibon, will not let two of his children of God die.  Her mother
would return to her.  He told Nalantei that Teresa wished to stay
with her until Sienti was strong again. Teresa spoke to the priest in
his words and frightened Nalantei with the sadness she showed.  To
Nalantei she said, "Your mother is weak because she lost blood
and must remain at the mission dispensary for some days to be safe. 
You may see her soon." 
</p>
<p>

 Nalantei came to Sienti early the next day because she did not trust
that Ngai had not assumed her mother too, or else why had she not
been taken to her immediately; and that same evening she had seen the
priest carrying a small box by the hill where the old Samburu were
covered with earth and wondered why there need be a box if Ngai had
taken the baby as he said.  The face <I>was
</I>her mother's, she decided, the face she knew so well in its
smooth texture and severity &#151; but with her head uncovered in this
weakness of body, (a weakness accentuated by the white sheets and
metal posts of the bed which stood on four spindly legs like a
gerenuk) her mother was not Samburu for those days.  It was an older
face too, even in the faint smile that greeted her on her last visit
before Sienti returned, not whole but familiar, clothed again in the
familiar garb and ornament of her people.</p>
<p>
"The baby died?"  Nalantei asked.</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"But was I not your first?" 
</p>
<p>
"No," Sienti said, "and you were not the last, but you
are the one who lived, so now you are the last."  Sienti ran her
hand over her daughter's warm head in a motion that might have
been tenderness, but the tentative fingers tapped and lifted as they
smoothed so that Nalantei felt the motion as a gesture at a distance,
not even directed fully toward her but at an object removed, as one
may caress in quiet thought because the hand needs an object to
recall, to grasp.  "The priest made me live without a son.  I
was bleeding, and do not remember, but he made me live."</p>
<p>
So then Nalantei knew that she might have had a brother but did not,
and that only her eyes saw as they did, and her fine senses were to
be alone, she sharing no blood with another, and she knew also why
her mother's belly would never grow large again.  
</p>
<p>
Perean would not speak of it.  Nalantei knew it was a strange oasis
for her father, this settlement of Loiyangalani, where cattle cannot
thrive and wives cannot bear children, where a mission and a few guns
make a barren claim among the palms and acacia, where a man must
stay, weaker and poorer in cattle, take no second wife and never have
a son.</p>
<p>
"It is that way for women sometimes," Teresa had said. 
"The white Laibon, the priest, said that your mother will return
to you soon."</p>
<p>
Nalantei had often remembered that evening and the words of Teresa,
which she had known were insufficient, incomplete.  It was like the
cattle, Nalantei thought; she knew what she had seen, that sometimes
they die, the little calf lies motionless, inert, or the cow, whose
eyes bulge in the vapid terror of first labor, collapses, and the
calf cannot pass to the earth; but no Laibon comes to free the calf
with his knife, and the cow will die and the cow body, which will not
be meat, is taken to the desert to be forgotten, alone as if she
never existed, was never suckled herself, and never loved.</p>
<p>
It was just then, on that night alone with Teresa, that Nalantei had
first observed the change.  Teresa, like her mother, also bore the
shape that brought the threat of metal &#151; the knife that tore
women's bodies and stretched their faces in age and sadness &#151; and
so Nalantei wished the creature growing in Teresa might shrink away
as she had seen occur long ago with her mother; so that Teresa would
be as before, unthreatened, ageless, almost a girl like herself, and
bring her to the mission school as she promised, to share their words
and songs.  "You can feel the child inside me," Teresa
said, "how it moves as it waits to be born."  But Teresa's
thoughts were not Nalantei's.  It was not the child.</p>
<p>
As Teresa had been to Nalantei, so Nalantei became to the younger
girl, Kioban, with whom she walked and laughed in the high sun while
the elders slept.  They had spoken of Teresa, who, in their devised
alarm and night-shared foreboding would have a child or would die . .
. but the creature did not shrink away within but grew into a boy
that walked beside her, to whom she gave milk from her body and to
whose tiny hand Nalantei was drawn, to squeeze just lightly if she
met them while walking, though Teresa did not come so often to their
nkang and did not bring the boy to Sienti's sight.  
</p>
<p>
The school was good, as Teresa said, and so too, the white Laibon was
faithful to his words; her mother did return to her. The priest was
truly the father of the mission and the school.
